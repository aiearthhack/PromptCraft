70423,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"We built an electronic health record (EHR) that supports quality wherever medicine is practiced, whether this be in remote Wassadou at Senegal's border with Guinea or MiniMe Pediatrics in busy Jakarta. WD EHR users panic when the internet shuts off. That's why we're building an off-line version!","<p>In the Senegalese healthcare system, the intersection of unmet need, overstretched resources, and inefficient processes lead, as in many low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC), to poor health outcomes that disproportionately impact those living in or near poverty. For the 67.5% of Senegalese citizens who survive on less than $3.20 a day, poor health outcomes feed well-documented vicious cycles of prolonged work absences, physical disability, protracted illness, debilitating stress and overwhelming financial impacts on families when members fall sick. </p>
<p>Walking Doctors (WD) seeks to simultaneously address several complimentary problems that contribute to resource scarcity and poor health outcomes in the context of patient care. First, doctors face enormous workloads due to high patient-to-provider ratios. In Senegal there is 1 doctor per 1000 people. In comparison there are 58 doctors per 10,000 people in the UK – a difference of 64 times. Second, providers are inherently challenged to remember the diagnosis and treatments for thousands of diseases and drugs. In combination, these factors mean that patients often receive the wrong treatment. In low and middle income countries (LMICs) like Senegal, more than 50% of post-diagnosis medical care is delivered contrary to the medical evidence-base with an astounding 4 of every 10 patients harmed (WHO).</p>
<p>Third, clinical resources are wasted through the mismanagement of stocks and supply chains for medicines and supplies. For bilateral programs in sub-Saharan Africa, 25% of supplies are routinely unaccounted for or lost. </p>
<p>Finally, the vast majority of Senegal’s 1,347 medical facilities employ almost exclusively paper medical record keeping. This causes multiple problems. Efficiency wise, health staff lose precious time searching for records, re-taking histories, trying to decipher illegible notes, and tracking studies. More seriously, lack of visibility into clinical performance prevents quality improvement. So, while Covid-19 killed 2,000 Senegalese, in the same period more than 100,000 Senegalese children under 5 years died of treatable non-Covid illness.</p>
<p>Walking Doctors' (WD) electronic health record system specifically addresses these problems by coordinating health leadership, data collection, patient-provider interactions, and accurate diagnostics around quality care. Regularly and consistently practiced every day, this will prepare Senegal for novel threats, which will come one day.</p>","<p>Walking Doctors (WD) offers an easy to use, comprehensive, cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) that uniquely incorporates evidence-based treatment protocols available in multiple languages (presently English, Spanish, French and Indonesia). WD’s EHR is specifically designed to address the challenges of accessibility, availability, usability, and quality faced by providers in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs): </p>
<p>1. A library of best practice treatment algorithms.</p>
<p>WD drives providers to exceed WHO standards and SMART methodology through routine use of over 200 evidence-based disease and condition algorithms, elegantly restructured into electronic checklists. In WD’s EHR, checklists guide providers to record pertinent negative and positive findings, to send confirmatory studies, to order medicines at the right dose and to conclude visits with patient education. Providers at all levels benefit from SMART checklists which make correct choices easy while sustaining patient throughput. In a country like Senegal, where busy healthcare workers have less formal medical education, access to a library of dynamic, integrated and professional checklists can transform care.</p>
<p>2. Real-time feedback. </p>
<p>WDs EHR tells clinicians at the point of care how they are doing via a red-light, green-light quality signalling system. Clicking a quality status bar displays a decision tree that highlights correctly documented steps or deviations from protocol logic. This includes failure to enter a patient’s respiratory rate or prescription of the wrong class of antibiotics. This last stage of WHOs SMART methodology reinforces to health staff the most contemporary standards for not just ANC, but for all of the most important diseases and conditions, allowing for care correction (and improved outcomes) along with increased staff satisfaction regarding routine delivery of high-quality care.</p>
<p>3. A rich medical record. </p>
<p>As clinical staff confirm signs, symptoms and treatment steps, a detailed medical record is automatically created. The online nature and detail in the record enables typical uses such as quick access to patient histories, exams and laboratory results, but also novel ones such as anonymised research, automated notification of sentinel events, documentation of health disparities, and real-time epidemic monitoring when there is preponderance of symptoms.</p>
<p>4. Integrated Pharmacy Management. </p>
<p>WD has a complete pharmacy management module that includes, clinic formulary, dosing, drug inventories, stock-keeping, pricing and report writing. There is no need to use competing software. Dramatically improved pharmacy management is imperative in public health centers, which run their own pharmacies, where medicines are often over-prescribed and stocked-out during emergencies.</p>
<p>5. Data and Systems integration. </p>
<p>Within security controls, all of the data in the WD system can be exported or integrated with health databases, including DHIS-2 using FIHR or other standards.</p>
<p>6. Off-line functionality. </p>
<p>Connectivity in the world is increasingly ubiquitous but still there are places and times when the internet turns off. When this happens, WD utilizes local hotspots to allow devices to continue sharing and interfacing. When internet connection is reestablished, locally stored data is beamed back into the cloud. WD is built with state of the art application design principles, allowing it to run on networks with limited bandwidth.</p>","<p>Sinthian Clinic on Senegal’s easternmost border with Mauritania and Mali as well as Wassadou Clinic in Senegal’s Tambacounda Region which neighbors Gambia are the two sites this grant will serve. The proximity of these clinics to the porous borders of its neighboring countries puts WD’s EHR at the heart of Senegal’s most exposed populations to the destabilization of climate change, migration, and conflict. This is expressed in dismal maternal and child mortality rates: 1 in 317 Senegalese mothers die during childbirth and 38 of 1,000 children will not live to celebrate their 1st birthday. In the U.S., these ratios are 1 in 33,000 and 3 of 1,000, respectively. </p>
<p>Wassadou Clinic, a primary care facility, serves a cachment of 20,000 people. Though Wassadou is a private facility, public healthcare infrastructure in the region is insufficient. By law, all activities in Wassoudou are reported to Senegal's Ministry of Health in the form of reports painstakingly gathered from paper medical records.</p>
<p>Sinthian Clinic’s doctors, midwives and nurses see more than 12,000 patients a year. Thousands of villagers are reliant on Sinthian for their primary care which in 2021 recorded 14,000 visits. EHR access for Sinthian providers and patients alike would be transformative and serve as a model for many similarly distanced healthcare facilities in sub-Saharan Africa where the lights (and internet) are commonly turned off. Sinthian like Wassoudou exclusively employs handwritten medical records.</p>
<p>Although Senegal retains a largely stable democracy, the 40-year insurgency in the Casamance region to the west of Wassadou also poses challenges. As a result, WD’s EHR will operate to not only strengthen these health systems, but build the coping capacity to manage the adverse conditions posed by their locations. The nature of an EHR system like WD is that it can impact care across an entire  geographic area. WD’s EHR checklists enable protocol adherence when providing urgent care under pressure without compromising quality.</p>
<p>With NGO partner Le Korsa, WD is committed to reversing dismal health trends for patients throughout Senegal. The diversity across Senegal’s context and people will demand multi-pronged solutions, but all will require concurrent continuous application of the best clinical decision support and health system management tools. This is WD's EHR.</p>","<p>The project brings together a rich and diverse set of individuals with expertise in emergency and primary care, health system strengthening, software development, and data science.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson Wang, founder and CEO of Walking Doctors, is a pediatrician based out of New York. Walking Doctor’s foundation story evolved over a decade in Sub-Saharan Africa, culminating in the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic and the difficulties in managing both accurate patient care and wider public health information needs. Dr. Wang, then working for the International Rescue Committee, saw first-hand how every aspect of the Ebola response was impacted by the interplay of poor record-keeping, low standards of supportive clinical care in treatment units, high mortality rates, lack of community trust, poor uptake of public health messaging, and insufficient data sharing and action (Time, 2014). Fast forward 8 years: Walking Doctors produces the only EHR for LMICs engineered for quality defined as effective, efficient and equitable patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Allegra Tsongo is the CEO of Le Korsa, an international NGO that has worked out of Senegal supporting health care projects in the country for over a decade. Le Korsa sponsors Keur Djiguene Yi Women and Children's Clinic in Dakar, a current user of WDs EHR. It also sponsors Sinthian and Wassadou in Eastern Senegal— the sites of this project— the only health facilities within 3 hours of the nearest regional hospitals.</p>
<p>Sinthinan and Wassadou serve 40 to 50 patients a day under the leadership of Dr. Magueye Ba who dreams of an EHR to both support and magnify his team's essential work. Currently, there is no reliable internet in the region. While the project presents a tested electronic health record to Dr. Ba (in French!), the modern flexible build of WD’s EHR will allow him to create his own patient surveys, customize performance dashboards, automate government health data reports and formally task shift work to nursing staff and community health workers by sharing access to diagnostic and treatment checklists on a system that works on a smartphone. For the first time, Dr. Ba will have stock management capability, billing support and visualization of staff work intensity, frequency and location.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry in Senegal is initiating efforts to install electronic health records in primary and secondary healthcare facilities. The Ministry has green lighted the pilot of WD's EHR in the aforementioned contexts with a focus on testing automated and high-quality secure data sharing into its new national health information repository.</p>
<p>Joaquin Budiaman, Senior Engineer, is in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Joaquin is a full stack hacker, meaning he can code from all sides of the system, developing content that is intuitive and pleasing to users while making sure data is securely and expertly organized for storage, access and use.</p>
<p>A 6-person Clinical Advisory Board provides critical contributions to WD's EHR checklist content. Board members are highly respected and accomplished international healthcare experts from Harvard, Hopkins, the Navy and UCSF.</p>","Improve accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts around the world (such as refugees and other displaced people, women and children, older adults, LGBTQ+ individuals, etc.)",New York City,United States,"Growth: An organization with an established product, service, or business model that is rolled out in one or more communities",,"<p>WD's EHR now runs in 8 healthcare facilities in Indonesia including 2 dental offices and 1 pediatric practice in Jakarta; In Liberia's only pediatric Diabetes Type I clinic in Monrovia; and as of 2022, in Keur Djiguene Yi, a free Woman and Children's Health Center in Dakar, Senegal - WD's first operation in French! WD is currently negotiating work with Alight in Somalia and Ethiopia for an expected reach of 50,000 and 100,000 in 2024.</p>","<p>NOVEL TECHNOLOGY IN TRADITIONAL PLACES</p>
<p>WD proposes that MIT/SOLVE spur the pace of healthcare improvement by subsidizing the project’s EHR customisation costs, which includes off-line functionality, composition of automated health reports and integration with Health Ministry data relays; as well as implementation costs which will involve 4 person local and international team training and supporting Wassadou and Sinthian clinic, each for 1 week. This eliminates key barriers to EHR adoption while giving health leadership first-hand experience and rationale to continue subscriptions beyond the initial period of support, which takes time to budget. While WD’s modest subscription fee pays for itself over and over again, EHR adjustment and training fees are needed to incentivise health systems leaders who currently operate without even a basic EHR, and who may be slow to realize the value proposition of quality-focused data management systems against competing work demands. WD’s EHR is as complete as one will find in LMICs, but like all new technology, it requires adjustment to local care culture to increase staff buy-in and acceptability. This will now include off-line functionality via local hotspots, excellent UX on a simple smartphone and use by less formally trained health providers including community health workers</p>
<p>IMMATURE LOCAL DATA REGULATIONS</p>
<p>Walking Doctors operates under the highest standards of data security. It applies U.S. patient privacy (HIPAA) standards as a baseline. Patient data is stored in the cloud at dual AWS sites in case there is a data breach or black out. WD’s CTO is a data security expert. And WD will never sell its data to marketers. Yet, electronic health data management capacity in LMICs is nascent, which commonly leads to Health Ministries stalling innovations in data sharing for lack of standards on patient data definition, format, transfer and storage. MIT/ SOLVE undoubtedly has experience working with Health Ministries on health innovations that do not compromise data privacy and security, while working on codifying standards when not present. WD would welcome such a prestigious company in elaborating Health Information System requirements.</p>
<p>REACH</p>
<p>Walking doctor wants to increase availability and accessibility to its one-of-a-kind quality focused EHR but knows that it cannot do it alone. WD was incorporated in 2018 as a Delaware C-corps to ease product development and speed implementation, but this unpredictably closed off the company to  NGOs, Foundations and Ministries. The MIT Solve opportunity is a trisector opportunity, one where sector labels give way to partnership realities, where the singular objective is to dramatically improve human health and health system performance every day is necessary to ease real human suffering as  well as to prepare for novel threats.</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Other (please specify),<p>The MIT/SOLVE opportunity was advertised on the Gates Grand Challenges list-serv</p>,"<p>WD’s electronic health record (EHR) is an interface in which the multifaceted levels and moving parts of health systems, from patient interaction to measurement of clinical effectiveness, become a collective continuum of care. Human experiences in health systems are at the center of WD’s EHR design. Indeed, WDs EHR was initially designed by a physician then continuously improved through feedback from users and purchasers. <br /></p>
<p>At the clinical level, WD’s checklists encapsulate and streamline steps from the construction of medical notes for patient history and diagnosis to coordination with the necessary staff and departments for continuity of care. Using the checklist as the primary care-relay, the EHR produces cohesive instructions for the nurses on what labs to draw and deliver, for the pharmacy on what prescriptions (with the correct dosing) to dispense, for the provider on essential discharge instructions, and onward, keeping track of essential actions in the process of care delivery. The net effect is to increase health provider adherence to protocols from 35% to 85% across all major diseases and conditions and to decrease overuse of medicines by 50%. These same results will be attainable by regions currently off the Internet grid— over 50% of Senegal’s outpatient clinics— with WD’s novel offline functionality.</p>
<p>At the administrative level, WD’s EHR signals when there is a death, when drug inventories fall low, and when disease incidence is too high. In Senegal, when a doctor writes a prescription it must be physically run over to the Pharmacy. If the prescription is for antibiotics or intravenous fluids, the patient must first pay for it! These are just two examples of the usefulness of even pharmacy data: The stories they tell provide the impetus and means for change.</p>
<p>At the system level, all data in the WD system can be passively exported and integrated with Ministry health databases, including DHIS-2 using FIHR. WDs automatic data exchange build can become a model in a country which still relays health data to the Ministry via excel. Also,WD’s data organisation allows health leaders to see who is sick, with what, to what consequence and where— in real time. Data displays further empowered by GIS-visualisation are not only essential to managing today’s disease burdens but in detecting aberrations in condition prevalence which presage epidemics. </p>
<p>In sum, WD’s EHR is an innovative approach for fragile contexts because it offers software, features and processes essential for any high functioning healthcare system. Furthermore, when fragile contexts crumble, destabilising events can arguably be predicted and responded to before crisis, so long as technology is constantly applied to support effective and efficient care with the data to prove it. This includes giving insight and practice into change strategies that are essential in peacetime, and out. WD EHR is this kind of technology.</p>","<p>YEAR ONE</p>
<p>The project will achieve two primary outcomes: Significant adherence to protocols proven to save lives across the top 10 diseases and conditions impacting each of maternal, child and neonatal cohorts (though WD features over 200 checklists) and routine utilisation of performance tools by District and Ministry leadership to drive health system improvement.</p>
<p>Walking Doctors offers an electronic health record (EHR) uniquely built to increase compliance to medical protocols, avoiding errors in care and preventable death. 30% of all deaths in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) can be prevented by access to primary care, but only if delivered effectively (Lancet, 2018). Accordingly, we will raise documented care effectiveness by 100% at Le Korsa's clinics of Wassadou and Sinthian and two public primary care facilities of the government's choice. </p>
<p>That’s at the patient-provider level. WD’s build produces protected and anonymised structured-data for public health. Such data, stratified by geography, gender, ethnicity and indicators of socioeconomic status has enormous potential to inform health care programming. Accordingly, district Ministries will then be able to routinely utilise data automatically transferred from WD’s EHR during health planning meetings. When necessary Senegal's Health Ministry will be able to rapidly disseminate information and adjustment to care protocols for evolving threats through additions and adjustments to WD checklists, which the project will track.</p>
<p>YEARS 1-5</p>
<p>Based on year one successes, we plan to rapidly expand EHR use throughout Senegal through meetings, presentations, advertisement and word of mouth with a target of 1.5 million patients cared for by primary care providers using a checklist-based EHR. This corresponds to about 300 clinics and health centers from a total of ~1,200 primary facilities of which 25% are private.</p>
<p>With 2 million patients receiving high quality primary care, this means in Senegal at least1485 lives saved. This likely underestimates WD's impact as we expect other EHR vendors to imitate WD EHR methodology including in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia. To WD, there is more than enough work to share!</p>
<p>Finally, public facilities typically adopt innovations of the private sector, not the other way around. So another measured objective of this proposal is for at least 50% of the increase in primary health care clinics during years 1-5 using WD's EHR will occur in public primary clinics and health centers.</p>","3. Good Health and Well-being, 9. Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure, 10. Reduced Inequalities, 17. Partnerships for the Goals","<p>The goal of this project is to increase adherence to health protocols proven to safe lives. To achieve this, we will ensure that health providers refer to evidence-based protocols during the course of outpatient care. In turn, health leadership will share high-quality health services and clinical results data with the Ministry of Health, quarterly.</p>

<p>KPI 3d. Qualitative study</p>","<p>WDs electronic health record (EHR) dramatically improves health provider adherence to clinical protocols proven to reduce suffering and death without slowing down care. In short, WD provides low and middle income countries (LMIC) access to a resource essential to healthcare strengthening and oversight at an affordable cost, fundamentally challenging the low-bar standard typically laid out for LMIC health systems. </p>
<p>We achieve this by having doctors and health staff work through evidence-based algorithmic checklists which bolster patient care capacity while informing best practice. Checklists work across all industries – from the complex and high-stakes aviation industry to the ubiquitous fast-food industry – because their format is logical and familiar, and they can apply to healthcare too. Within individual medical fields, this has been shown to be true: Surgery (Gawande), Intensive Care Deep line placement (BMC Infect Dis. 2018 Jun 8;18(1):267), and neonatal feeding (Annals of Global Health Jun 2014. 80[3]). Why not deploy checklists in the support of care for all diseases and conditions? WD is the answer to this question.</p>
<p>WD’s EHR is a mechanism for changing health outcomes, care quality, and systems efficiency. But it begins with implementation through collaboration and engagement. This system is made powerful by the people behind it, so its uptake by providers is key. Transitions from paper to electronic record keeping can be radical in resource poor settings, but also because changes in systems require a rewiring of operations through practitioner behavior changes. The development of trust and mutual engagement in WD’s EHR implementation is the first step in the sustainability of its success. </p>
<p>WD’s EHR is also a mechanism for structural change. The impact of WD’s EHR extends beyond the confines of its immediate operations. Unstructured health records leave leaders in the dark on the extent of problems and ways to solve them. WD’s EHR gathers information that can paint a picture of how health systems are more than a sum of patient-provider interactions; revealing resource deprivation, health inequity and care gaps, as well as the socioeconomic drivers of ill health. With WD’s EHR, systems level changes can create population and community health improvements. Outcomes like greater care-seeking behavior, fewer economic shocks to families from extended disease costs or inability to work, improved maternal and child mortality statistics, as well as improved investments in education and social equity for women and girls are all possible with WD’s EHR.</p>
<p>WD’s EHR is also a mechanism for long term changes that strengthen health systems and build resilience. These changes take improvement a step beyond quality care and into disaster preparedness, response and recovery. By improving the quality of care and health outcomes, WD’s EHR gets ahead of tipping points in destabilisation. IN short, WD’s EHR exposes systemic risk, the interactions and relationships in the ecosystem of health that can be catalysts for  systems collapse. This knowledge puts health systems at an advantage, creating a map of itself from which to build up its own capacity to navigate the evolving threats in disease and disaster.</p>","<p>In the WD system, checklists are the way health providers document and act on patient care decisions. This strategy aligns with behavioral health theory whereby decisions can be positively influenced by making the correct choice obvious (through explicit presentation of protocols), employing some degree of peer pressure (users know their performance is being measured and compared) and making the sum of work easier (through checklist integrations)</p>
<p>The electronic health record (EHR) vehicle WD uses is created with java script, the language of the internet, meaning access to WDs EHR is easy and ubiquitous. In this project, we provide off-line technology through local solar/battery powered hotspots, but ultimately comprehensive care data is shared in the cloud.</p>
<p>EHRs contain sensitive data. From its inception WD Engineering has made it a policy to adhere to the highest standards of data security, system availability and patient privacy, exceeding typical standards used in the healthcare industry in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>This is a summary of some key practices. <br /></p>
<p>Reliability Practices</p>
<p>·      Data must be stored in at least two geographically distinct data centers and be durable in the event of one of the data centers becoming unavailable for any reason</p>
<p>·      Every data processing subsystem must be composed of multiple individual resources that are located in at least two geographically distinct data centers. Such subsystems must be designed to survive the unavailability of a single data center.</p>
<p>·      Network connections into Walking Doctors systems should terminate as close to the end user as possible.</p>
<p>·      Customer data must be separated such that data resources for customers may be operated independently of each other.</p>
<p>Security Practices</p>
<p>·      All data, (including medical data) must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.</p>
<p>·      All cloud systems involved in data processing must be configured in accordance with the Cloud Security Policy.</p>
<p>·      Customer and staff logins to our applications use cryptographically signed, expiring access tokens that can be revoked.</p>
<p>·      Customer passwords must be evaluated on the basis of an estimated password strength of “Safely Unguessable” as determined by the Zxcvbn password strength estimation algorithm.</p>
<p>·      Employee and contractor passwords must be evaluated on the basis of an estimated password strength of “Very Unguessable” as determined by the Zxcvbn password strength estimation algorithm.</p>
<p>·      Where possible, medical data must be cryptographically signed by users that last updated the data. </p>
<p>·      We employ automatic systems for detection, notification and remediation of software vulnerabilities, as well as manual review of system changes.</p>
<p>Privacy Practices</p>
<p>·      Access to patient data is not granted by default to customer users, but rather granted explicitly by a customer user with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>·      Employee and contractor system access must be granted and reviewed in accordance with the Access Control Policy.</p>
<p>·      Access to patient data by Walking Doctors employees and contractors is made on a least authority basis. By default, only the CEO, CTO and senior members of the Operations team have access to patient data for the purposes of system’s monitoring and maintenance only.</p>

<p>In the for-profit sector, customer acquisition is the best test of product functionality. </p>
<p>1) Alight just chose WDs EHR over an established long standing alternative</p>
<p>2) WD was a featured presenter at IMNCH2023 in Capetown this May garnering praise and followup conversation with Ministry representatives from Nigeria and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>3) Senegal's Ministry has green-lighted this EHR initiative over competitors because no other EHR including OpenMRS can provide similar value in terms of comprehensiveness of features and low price. For a separate initiative in its 2 largest hospitals, the Ministry has already approved a $30K a year subscription fee for each of the two hospitals following an initial period of USAID funded customisation, trainer or trainers and implementation support.</p>

<p>Additionally, WD's EHR captures protected and anonymised structured data for public health and analytics. Such data, which includes minorities and those with varying socioeconomic status, has enormous potential for new forms of analysis on disease prevalence and characteristics. This will be a rich resource for doctors, public health departments, ministries, and researchers typically confronted with data accuracy and collection challenges, which thwart understanding of healthcare disparities in the first place.</p>
<p>The burden of global health disparities is multiplied by the intersectionality of disadvantage in which poverty, gender, sexuality, and race become compounding factors in a person’s health. With WD’s EHR, populations made vulnerable by their intersecting burdens are provided quality care suited to diverse needs. In this way, WD’s EHR re-imagines health equity in the most underserved parts of the world, alleviating the burden of structural violence which defines health systems in both LMICs and HICs. WD’s EHR is a critical first step towards health equity.</p>
<p>WDs CEO is a person of color. WDs Medical Director is Muslim, Indonesian and a woman. Four of six of WDs clinical advisors are underrepresented minorities and half of them women. Walking Doctors foundation story narrates a first-ever attempt to bring a quality-engineered electronic health record to the world's poorest citizens. The fight for global health equity is at the core of WD's mission to provide quality care anywhere.</p>","<p>In 2019, Walking Doctors successfully completed an 18 month pilot of its cloud-based, quality-focused electronic health record (EHR) in Pakpak Bharat, Indonesia—a District of 50,000 residents in remote northern Sumatra. In doing this, WD transitioned all 7 District Health Centers from paper medical records to an EHR, decreased registration time from 20 to 5 minutes, increased chart completeness from 1% to 95% and improved adherence to protocols from 35% to 85%-- across all diseases. The Governor of Pakpak Bharat was so pleased with the results including savings from a 50% reduction in unnecessary prescriptions that he built WD subscription costs into the District's budget for three years. This provided proof-of-concept for Walking Doctors' SaaS business model, even when working with governments. </p>
<p>That WD could work in the harsh conditions of Pakpak Bharat gave WD confidence to expand to Indonesia’s bustling capital of Jakarta with its 10 million residents. WD recruited 10 private clinics and dental offices each representing about 5 thousand patients to use its EHR. Then Covid-19 hit. The challenging nature of in-person implementations and a new decree mandating that all 60,000 outpatient clinics use an EHR led to the development of a new self-sign up process with electronic payment and 100% contactless training via embedded help videos and intuitive UX. This implementation model will be tested in Indonesia before June with the potential to magnify sales in and outside of Indonesia.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the NGO Le Korsa began using WD’s EHR at its free women and children’s clinic Keur Djigeune Yi in Dakar, Senegal. The success of this project brought Le Korsa and WD together as partners for a USAID proposal to bring electronic health records into the Capitol's two busiest hospitals. Up to this point, the government of Senegal has been unable to develop or find an affordable, customizable EHR that impacted care outcomes. In seeing the WD product (in French no less), the Health Ministry committed to purchasing follow-on subscriptions which it did not find expensive, though the project would be first supported by a bilateral grant.</p>
<p>WD continues to aspire towards global impact. It is collaborating with the NGO Alight to implement WDs EMR in clinics in Somalia in Somali (WD is already offered in French, Spanish, Indonesia and English) within a B2B model.</p>",Individual consumers or stakeholders (B2C),"<p>Walking Doctors follows a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenue model, whereby facilities pay for EHR subscriptions (and computers) from their own operational budgets as opposed to being provided them as grants. This uniquely addresses the typical sustainability dilemma of innovation adoption in LMIC. 80% of WD users continue their subscriptions past two years. Subscription costs are calculated from several factors and are vastly more affordable compared to existing systems that require infrastructure, data management, and additional support staff.</p>
<p>Still, help with subscription fees increases the pace of technology adoption. This eliminates the number one barrier to EHR uptake -- money -- while giving healthcare leadership first-hand experience, rationale and lead-time to continue subscriptions beyond the initial support period, which takes time to budget. 80% of WD subscribers maintain their subscriptions beyond two years. point mirrors WD’s previous experience in Indonesia: Concurrent with two years placing and supporting use of EHRs in Pakpak Bharat, WD worked with the District Health Officer and Governor to secure funding for WD EHR subscriptions to 7 health centers for 3 years. The pact was celebrated on May 17, 2018 signing with explicit negotiation that if international investment delivered on purported objectives, it would be matched by domestic investment on future value.</p>
<p>In short, once health facilities start using WD's EHR, users (and patients) quickly become aware of the indispensable nature of a checklist-focused, user-centered and modern electronic health record.</p>","<p>The success of Walking Doctors 18-month pilot in 2018-2019 of its electronic health record in 7 Health Centers in Sumatra, Indonesia resulted in a District budget line of $300 per Health Center per month for a period of three years. Indonesia has over 10,000 Health Centers. Based on this success and work by WD’s new CEO in Indonesia, WD will sign an MOU on May 17 with APKASI, the Indonesian governors association to vend its product to Indonesia’s 153 Districts.</p>
<p>WD awaits a decision on the 2-year USAID petitioned grant to support Senegal's pre-eminent public hospitals, Diamniadio Children's Hospital and Fann Speciality Hospital in Dakar. Each of these public facilities has agreed to pay a $30K annual maintenance fee following successful implementation of WDs quality engineered electronic health record (EHR). Both institutions, despite caring for hundreds of thousands of patients a year, still use paper medical records.</p>
<p>WD is currently working with Alight on three grants to provide its services at Alight supported health facilities in Somalia and Ethiopia. Together, WD and Alight submitted a Google grant to support AI driven epidemic surveillance using data largely drawn from WD supported health care facilities.</p>
<p>This month, WD released a self-signup version of its EHR in Indonesia, where for a subscription fee, users can establish health facilities and invite staff to join with specified clinical permissions. This process can be seen here: <a href=""http://www.walkingdocs.com/"">www.walkingdocs.com</a>. We expect at least 10 new subscriptions our first month, then a month-over-month 100% increase in users, as use of an EHR for outpatient clinics is now law with compliance urged by the end of 2023. There are 60,000 clinics in Indonesia with less than 10% currently online.

The solution proposed is a comprehensive, cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) system designed with off-line functionality to ensure accessibility in remote or internet-challenged areas. This EHR system incorporates evidence-based treatment protocols in multiple languages, integrates a library of over 200 disease and condition algorithms, real-time feedback mechanisms, pharmacy management modules, and capabilities for data and system integration. The technology is in the Growth stage, currently serving facilities in Indonesia, Liberia, and Senegal, and planning expansions into Somalia and Ethiopia, reaching an estimated 150,000 to 200,000 individuals by 2024.

WD’s EHR specifically targets underserved regions and populations, including clinics near Senegal's borders where health resources are scarce, and the insurgency in the Casamance region poses additional challenges. The proposed solution aims to serve two clinics in Senegal: the Sinthian Clinic and the Wassadou Clinic, engaging with these facilities to improve health outcomes significantly by enhancing healthcare delivery's quality and efficiency.

The team behind Walking Doctors is described as diverse, bringing together expertise across emergency and primary care, health system strengthening, software development, and data science. This multidisciplinary team includes pediatrician Dr. Wilson Wang, CEO of Walking Doctors, and various international healthcare experts contributing to the EHR's content development and implementation.

WD operates on a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) revenue model, where healthcare facilities pay subscription fees for using the EHR. This model has proved viable, with WD sustaining subscriptions beyond pilot implementations and planning for substantial growth and expansion. Walking Doctors anticipates increasing its reach and impact by facilitating the adoption of its EHR system in more clinics and health centers in Senegal and LMICs, aiming to dramatically improve patient care, healthcare efficiency, and public health outcomes.

70650,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"An armed conflict has displaced over 400,000 persons (mainly women and children) to informal settlements with no health care services. This solution will provide a comprehensive package of health services through ECHO & telemedicine using a hospital hub & locally trained Community Health workers.","<p>The Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon are the two English-speaking regions of the ten regions in the country, with a population of almost five million inhabitants (20% of Cameroon's population). These regions have experienced an armed conflict since 2017 with over 4000 people killed, over 400,000 internally displaced and at least 80,000 externally displaced into neighbouring Nigeria. This has resulted in disruption and massive closure of health facilities, poor access to health services for the displaced rural populations, and health providers fleeing the conflict zone. The displaced population has moved into very remote informal settlements, which are considered safe from warring parties of the crisis. Unfortunately, in these informal settings, there are no basic amenities like housing, water, sanitation, health care services or schools. Access to these informal settlements is exceedingly difficult and there are no established economic activities for the displaced women to make a living and support their families. This displaced population is subject to poverty, lack, and poor health and this has significantly increased the morbidity and mortality rate of this population, especially maternal, infant and childhood mortalities from common preventable, infectious diseases and injuries. The displaced population is also living in a very fragile security situation because they are often involved in the crossfire and constant attacks by the warring parties, especially in their efforts to travel and seek basic healthcare in health facilities in neighbouring towns. With the increasing severity of the armed crisis and the progressive deterioration of health services for this displaced population, there is an urgent need to structure a solution to improve the health status of this population through preventive, health promotion, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services.</p>","<p>Following lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing evidence that quality health care can be provided to individuals, families and communities remotely through telehealth/telemedicine programs. Additionally, evidence from the Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO) project implemented by the University of New Mexico and the AIDS Educational Training Centers (AETC) in the NW of the USA, has shown that capacity can be transferred from more specialized complex health settings to very remote, resource-limited settings using Community Health workers (CHWs) to obtain high-quality health outcomes for the community.<br /></p>
<p>Based on both models (Telemedicine and ECHO), Hi4D plan to implement a telemedicine and ECHO solution, to provide continuous and good quality health care to over 250,000 displaced population in informal settings, resulting from the armed crisis in Cameroon, especially targeting women and children. This model will identify community health workers (CHWs) living within the displaced population, train, and mentor them through the ECHO model and use them to provide health promotion and preventive medical services to the population. Hi4D has an established partnership agreement with the ECHO project of the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>In addition, the solution will also use a telemedicine model with the FHL Medical Center hub to provide specialized medical care to individuals and families in informal settings using the hub and spoke model. The CHWs will be guided to set up spoke sites in these informal settlements with basic telephone and mobile internet connection to link up with specialists' medical providers in the FHL hub to guide targeted individualized medical care to members of the displaced settlement. </p>","<p>The population that this solution will serve are a sizable proportion of the over 400,000 displaced people from the armed crisis who are now living in informal settlements. Specifically, women and children in this population will be targeted for preventive and curative medical services. This population is currently living in extremely poor hygienic conditions with congestion and poor sewage disposal, no portable water supply, poor environmental conditions, and no economic activities to improve their nutrition and environmental conditions. They are exposed to both environmental and nutritional predictors of poor health and injuries. This solution will seek to reduce their environmental exposure through health promotion, health education and prevention intervention through the Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) model. Prevention of disease interventions like proper waste disposal, treatment of water, immunization for children, malaria prevention with insecticide-treated nets, condom distribution and antenatal care for pregnant women will be capital in this solution through health education and working with the local Department of Health to supply basic commodities. Prevention will also focus on screening for TB, and multi-disease screening for chronic conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and HIV, using trained and mentored community health workers. Key community stakeholders (traditional healers, and community leaders) will be engaged in these health promotion and prevention activities.<br />For persons in this population who are already suffering from any disease condition, the telemedicine solution will help to provide diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these patients, using the FHL Medical Centre telemedicine unit as the hub and CHWs setting up and coordinating a satellite health post in the communities as spokes. Hi4D will help with the identification and setting up of satellite telehealth posts in five informal settlements hosting the most displaced populations.</p>
<p>The informal settlement will promote risky sexual behaviors and also favor sexual exploitation as a means of livelihood, this solution will also provide family planning education and services and support the implementation of contraceptive methods within this population to prevent unwanted pregnancies and ensure the birth spacing</p>
<p>With these coordinated interventions this solution will reduce infection, promote health and also treat basic diseases and overall improve the health outcomes of these displaced populations. </p>","<p>Our solution team will be made up of local stakeholders, trained CHWs, the Hi4D ECHO team, the FHL Medical Centre telemedicine unit and other developmental partners.<br />We will identify key community stakeholders to use in implementing the solution. Our community stakeholders are the community leaders and religious leaders who are trusted in these communities and have a say in the decisions of the communities. They will be responsible for sensitizing and mobilizing the community for services to be provided. The local department of health also has community actors who will be used to mobilize the communities while the department will supply primary health care services and commodities for these communities' health activities.<br />Community Health workers who have been displaced to live in these informal settlements will be identified, trained and mentored on primary health care services, the ECHO model and telemedicine services. They will be used as the intermediaries between the Hi4D ECHO team and the FHL telemedicine unit to deliver services to these populations.<br />HI4D has an ECHO team that has a partnership agreement with the University Of New Mexico ECHO project and will use this model to deliver health promotion and prevention activities. Hi4D will also leverage resources from the UNM ECHO worldwide project to provide evidence-based community health services and community interventions.<br />FHL Medical Center has a well-trained telemedicine unit with a team of specialists consisting of:</p>

<p>The solution will provide curative, chronic care and rehabilitative healthcare services to 5,000 patients per year (25,000 patients in 5 years) through telemedicine.<br /></p>","<p>With these solutions proposed to provide comprehensive health care for the displaced population, HI4D and FHL Medical Centre already have constituted ECHO teams and the telemedicine Unite. While HI4D is a registered local not-for-profit organization operating in the regions, FHL Medical Center is an independent Medical Care centre affiliated which has a signed agreement with Hi4D and will provide curative health care to the displaced population at a very subsidized rate. FHL Medical Centre has a functional telemedicine unit that is ready to provide free consultations to the displaced population in Cameroon through the telemedicine program and subsidized specialist care for complicated cases.</p>
<p>This solution will be privileged to benefit from SOLVE's expertise in technical assistance and SOLVE's network to mobilize financial resources to support this initiative. SOLVE's technical expertise and its extensive network of partners will be important to provide evidence-based and innovative strategies to tailor the ECHO and telemedicine interventions to the specific needs of these displaced populations. SOLVE will also guide the implementation of this model based on its experience of a similar model elsewhere. SOLVE and its network will also support financial solutions for the training of CHWs, stipends of selected CHWs intermediaries and for setting up and running of community satellite ECHO and telemedicine post. Most importantly, this solution will depend on the experience and technical support of the connected SOLVER network/ teams with partners who can help advance our solutions</p>","Business Model (e.g. product-market fit, strategy & development), Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Monitoring & Evaluation (e.g. collecting/using data, measuring impact)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Other (please specify),<p>Our organization Hi4D is a registered premium member of Funds for NGOs and our grants team usually looks for opportunities of interest to our organization and fortunately came across this exciting opportunity by Solve.</p>,"<p>The Northwest(NW) and the Southwest (SW) regions of Cameroon, with a population of five million inhabitants (20% of Cameroon's population) have experienced an armed conflict since 2017 with over 4000 people killed, over 400,000 internally displaced and at least 80,000 externally displaced (</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2018-march-2019/crisis-worsens-cameroon"">https://www.un.org/africarenew...</a>).  This has resulted in the disruption of economic and health activities, closure of hospitals, fleeing of health providers from the crisis, and population displaced to informal settlements with no access to health services. The most affected populations are women and children because their families have been killed in the crisis or have joined the militia leaving them to flee to safe havens. These women have lost their source of livelihood, are forced to become head of the household, have no economic activities in these new settlements and have no basic amenities for health, water, and sanitation services. Consequently, they have engaged in trading sex or other illegal acts as a means of sustaining their families. </p>
<p>The government has no means of reaching these populations due to poor transport, and insecurity and no basic services are planned for these informal settlements. </p>
<p>With the insecurity/poor access, we plan to implement an ECHO and telemedicine solution to provide continuous and quality healthcare to the displaced population targeting women and children. This model will identify community health workers (CHWs) living within these settlements, train and use them to implement and monitor preventive, curative, chronic care and rehabilitative health services in five selected displaced communities hosting most of the internally displaced women and children. Hi4D has an affiliated FHL Medical Centre with a pool of general and specialist clinicians that provide holistic medical care in the SW region and has a fully developed and functional telemedicine unit. Leveraging the widespread mobile phone/ internet network access in the country, this technology will be exploited to implement the telemedicine solution. Community stakeholders (community leaders and religious leaders with decision-making authorities in the communities) will be used to sensitize and mobilize the population within these settlements. Trained CHWs will set up megaphones at community venues where public health specialists can broadcast health promotion messages. Meanwhile, clients identified within the settlement with specific disease conditions will be consulted and offered expert treatment using the telemedicine model by the clinical/specialist team. </p>
<p>The solution will coordinate with the local Health Departments for basic public health services (immunization, hygiene, water, and sanitation), provision of medical supplies, and essential medications through an established route using local bikers. Local and international developmental partners (UNICEF, World Food Program) will be contacted to provide basic supplies to these displaced populations.</p>
<p>Telemedicine had been proven to be highly effective in providing quality health care remotely and this approach became widespread during the COVID-19 pandemic. This approach is poorly developed in Cameroon, but FHL Medical Center has an established and functional telemedicine team that has completed the Fundamentals of Telemedicine Operations with the Harvard University Telemedicine Unit</p>
<p>Hi4D has a partnership agreement with the University of New Mexico ECHO project.</p>","<p>Hi4D in collaboration with local stakeholders and the local department of health will map out the most populated informal settlements housing the most population (especially women and children), and informal settlements hosting more than 30,000 population will be targeted.</p>
<p> Community stakeholders (community leaders and religious leaders) with decision-making authorities in the communities will be used to sensitize and mobilize the population within these settlements and link them through ECHO for the provision of health education, health promotion and preventive messages by a team of public health experts. Identified and trained CHWs will be used to set up megaphones at community venues where the mobilized population will gather for the broadcast of health messages. This activity will target to reach out to 50,000 displaced population with quality preventive, health promotion, and health education messages per year. This activity will reach about 250,000 individuals in 5 years.</p>
<p>The FHL medical Center telemedicine team will train the identified 10 CHWs in each of the targeted communities (a total of 50 trained CHWs)  on telemedicine fundamentals and an additional 100 community stakeholders on primary healthcare approaches. These CHWs will select a health post within the informal settings (church or a tent) where basic and confidential medical consultation could take place and work with FHL to set up the basic telemedicine equipment (smart TV, Video conferencing and audio outlets, internet and mobile telephone set up). These satellite posts will be linked to the FHL telemedicine unit where the specialist will connect for individual confidential patient consultation and offer a line of management. The CHWs will be mentored on patient nursing and improvement follow-up according to an agreed management plan by the clinician. The clinical team will connect with the remote sites regularly to monitor the clinical improvement of the clients. The solution will provide curative, chronic care and rehabilitative healthcare services to 5000 patients per year (25,000 patients in 5 years) through telemedicine.</p>
<p>Local stakeholders and local transporters, especially bikers who have understood the dynamics of the crisis and can navigate their way to towns and to these displaced settlements will be engaged to set up a channel to facilitate the transport of essential medicines and medical supplies.<br />The local Ministry of health department will be engaged to facilitate the delivery of vaccines, essential medications (antimalarials, antiparasitic and antibiotics) and medical supplies. Local and international development partners will be engaged in the delivery of food and medical supplies. </p>
<p>Lessons learnt from this telehealth solution (which is still very poorly developed in Cameroon), will be shared with local and national stakeholders, and can set the pace for the MOH to serve the remote and inaccessible communities in Cameroon, even in the other 8 regions that do not have an armed crisis, considering that 60% of the country is rural and inaccessible in many aspects. This will also provide evidence for the development of telemedicine in the country.</p>",3. Good Health and Well-being,"<p>The project will collect routine hospital and public health data for service offices to patients and displaced populations in the informal settlement through telemedicine and ECHO services. Standard clinical registers and Primary health care data collection tools from the local department of health (hospital and community outreach tools) will be used. The indicators of interest collected in routine tools will be customized into a data software called DAMA. DAMA is an electronic version of hospital data found in hospital registers, which will integrate community indicators which will be used to aggregate and summarize the data for specific indicators for reporting to stakeholders.

This target population primarily consists of women and children who now reside in informal settlements without basic amenities, including healthcare services. The initiative plans to deploy a combined approach utilizing the Extension for Community Health Outcome (ECHO) model and telemedicine to deliver comprehensive health services. This approach leverages the partnership with the ECHO project of the University of New Mexico and the FHL Medical Center hub for telemedicine services. 

Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are part of the displaced populations, will be trained and mentored to provide health promotion, preventive medical services, and act as intermediaries for specialized medical care via telemedicine. The solution sets to reach 50,000 displaced individuals annually with preventive and educational health services and aims to provide curative, chronic, and rehabilitative services to 5,000 patients per year through telemedicine, totaling 25,000 patients in five years.

The solution's impact targets align with several UN Sustainable Development Goals, mainly focusing on Good Health and Well-being. Progress will be measured using routine data collection tools integrated into a software system for tracking various health indicators, such as maternal and under-5 mortality rates, disease prevention, and access to healthcare services.

The project is at the Pilot stage, proposing to test the model with a small group of users in five selected informal settlements hosting significant populations of internally displaced persons. The team involves local stakeholders, the Hi4D ECHO team, the FHL Medical Centre's telemedicine unit, trained CHWs, and other development partners.

71056,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,A network of trusted health specialists located anywhere in the world connected to our local fixed or mobile medical centers/laboratories partners or patient gadget via a mobile platform to provide access of quality care at low cost to anyone even in destabilizing events.,"<p>First we have to define what is a destabilizing event. Destabilizing event mean some events that cause a loss of equilibrium as a conflict, displacement or natural disasters. For certain societies where access to health care is difficult, these destabilizing event cause problem in the availability , accessibility and quality of health services.</p>
<p>The specific problem within the challenge that we are working to solve is to have access to health care even when the community is facing armed conflict. Because of armed conflict, people are more exposed to fragile context with higher risk to death. That include that people can not have primary care when needed because of local capacity issue. That also means that people can not have a quality of health service because of insecurity.</p>
<p>For example those armed conflict can be leaded by armed gang. In the community that we are working in, the percentage of armed gang is about 75% which cause a huge issue that prevent people to access properly to health care when needed. The whole population of a country can be affected by this problem. The right to health being part of the fundamental right, everyone should have an efficient health system and a way to receive help when needed. This is the reason why the team leader and the team thought about a solution to improve local capacity and build resilience in health system.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution provides a low-cost, secure and mobile platform matching patients with our network of trusted health specialists located anywhere in the world and local fixed or mobile medical centers/laboratories to provide access to quality care even in destabilizing situations. </p>
<p>It allows patients suffering a specific health problem (ex: headache, bellyache, etc) to quickly connect in a matter of seconds with one or more of our trusted remote physicians located anywhere in the world and who is/are well-suited to assist them for this specific health problem. The platform can match remote physicians working on a specific patient case with other  remote physicians located anywhere in the world. If the physician asks for the app, this makes our platform even more powerful.</p>
<p>The way it works is very simple:  The client uses his/her smartphone or any other small phone in case there is no access to internet connectivity and tells our system what he/she feels. Our platform thus connects them to one of our remote trusted health specialists for assistance. </p>
<p>There are two scenarios: </p>
<p>1) The problem does not require any physical intervention. In this case, the remote physician tells the patient which medication to take and might plan the next online appointment with the client for followup. </p>
<p>2) The online communication is not enough so that the physician can diagnose the patient, he asks him to make a  laboratory test or he wants to have access to his/her vital signs. In this case, the mobile app using GPS technology, guides the patient to one of our well-suited local laboratory partners/medical centers partners or in some very destabilizing situations, asks them to use our gadget which can take the patient's vital sign and assign this information to the patient document on the system so that the remote health specialist can access it and uses this information to provide a medication prescription and plan next appointment for other follow up. </p>
<p>Several remote health specialists can collaborate on a single patient case via the platform if there is need for that. Also, our mobile platform allows remote health specialists to collaborate with local generalist physicians working in local partnered health centers in order to better provide care to a patient on a specific health problem.
</p>
<p>In some cases, clients might feel uncomfortable to identify themselves. In situation, during online meetings on the platform between patients and remote health specialists, clients might have the choice to identify themselves or not. 
</p>
<p>Also, in order to make our platform a trusted place for patients, we define a safe strategy for health specialists to join the platform. They will be validated by a hospital or a university and sign a legal document engaging them to be accountable legally for the service they are provided on the system.</p>","<p>The target populations that interest us are those where people live in difficult situations because of destabilizing events that can put them in fragile contexts. Particularly people who live in countries where the government cannot respond effectively and efficiently to the  needs of the population. Therefore we are working to bring a significant change in the lives of these people. <br /></p>
<p>The health system being one of those that requires more logistics, staff and equipments, it becomes unavoidable that the governments of low-income countries where there can be violence, armed conflicts, poverty cannot not meet the healthcare needs of our target population.</p>
<p>In addition, because of these difficult contexts, the population is on its own, moving to a hospital can be difficult, so it is the wealthiest people who will have the means and access to health care.</p>
<p>What we offer with this solution is unlimited access to healthcare personnel at any time at any time. It will therefore meet their needs in an effective way because There will therefore be available to Our target population Specialists from all over the world ready to serve them and advise them on any of the diseases as real on our platform. In addition, thanks to this solution, anyone with a smartphone will be able to communicate, exchange with health personnel without having to move from one city to another.</p>","<p>Several reasons make us the right people to design and deliver this solution to the target population, but the biggest is the proximity we have to the target population that we serve this solution.</p>
<p>As said before, the target population to which we propose this solution is the one whose government cannot adequately meet their health needs while the population is facing destabilizing events such as armed conflicts or who have experienced destabilizing events in the past. As a natural disaster and the people are still dealing with the repercussions. The first example of a country that lived and still lives in this situation is the country that the team currently live in, that is to say: Haiti.<br />The team leader and the team come from the Haitian community, we have experienced and knowledged the problems of access to health care because they are part of the daily lives of our loved ones. This is why as young Haitian leader we made a field observation to better understand the needs of our target population. When designing this solution, the team leader and the team also called on health specialists and asked their opinions on this subject.<br />Its design and implementation are guided by the demand to be able to discuss and have medical opinions online. Several people that the team has consulted about this project in Our target community have admitted to having probably thought of having a means like the one we are proposing but which can come to nothing because of a lack of resources and logistics.</p>
<p>The design of Hopimobil and its implementation in the real life of the Haitian population could be a turning point in the health system in Haiti. It could guarantee access to a mobile platform of health experts for all in real time</p>","Increase local capacity and resilience in health systems, including the health workforce, supply chains, and primary care services","our solution team is headquartered in Port au Prince, the capital of Haiti.",,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone","<p>Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood. A prototype is the representation of the concept. It focuses on the full functionality of all included features.</p>
<p>Our solution is rather a prototype because we have gone beyond the ideology of this solution, we have materialized it.</p>
<p>Hopimobil is an application that can be operational with the necessary funds and resources. It has been tested by developers and can be installed already on smartphones. Hopimobile works and we can already connect to the platform and register as a patient, present the symptoms of the illness. The platform then compiles a medical file and sends the request to a specialist who can later give his medical opinion.</p>
<p> Of course it remains a prototype because we still have a lot of work to complete so that our solution can achieve its full effectiveness and viability.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution being still in the prototype phase, it is not yet on the market and is not yet available on application stores such as Google play store or apple store. Therefore currently Hopimobil has not yet helped anyone in the health system but our team is working to make this dream a reality in order to resiliently solve problems with health access even in destabilizing events.</p>","<p>We are applying to solve for several reasons: </p>
<p>1) Financial reason: If selected to be a Solver team, the 10 000 USD we will receive will be useful. For now, I am the only mobile developer working on the prototype. This is why I can start developing the solution without expending any money. And because I use (Firebase powerful, scalable cloud-based back-end solution, and flutter as a multi-platform solution from Google, and based on my experience on developing and releasing mobile app on both play store and app store, I am able to develop the prototype on my own. So, my team can use the 10 000 USD to pay additional developers to work on the solution and we can pay also for cloud services with a part of it. </p>
<p>2) Support to help our solution go to production and be scaled : We saw that solver teams have access to mentorship, coaching, and strategic advice from experts, as well as the Solve and MIT networks. This will help us to advance our solution.</p>
<p>3) Inspiration : As mention on the ""become-a-solver"" page at the Solve website, solver teams join a class of impressive peers acting as trusted as trusted support, inspiration and guidance, we will enjoy being part of that teams to get inspired and have enough energy and motivation to make the solution a reality. When being among like minded-people try to solve challenges of our time, we are more motivated. </p>
<p>4) Trust of the brand: Even if our solution is efficient, people need to trust it. For that to happen, being showed in the media and at conferences will help a lot. People will trust a brand better when they see people are talking about it everywhere. Even people in my community, they will have a higher image of the solution if they see people are globally talking about it. They will have a kind of pride. </p>","Financial (e.g. accounting practices, pitching to investors), Human Capital (e.g. sourcing talent, board development), Product / Service Distribution (e.g. delivery, logistics, expanding client base), Public Relations (e.g. branding/marketing strategy, social and global media), Technology (e.g. software or hardware, web development/design)","No, Solve is the first network joined",,Email from Solve,<p>Via email notifications from Solve. </p>,,,3.

The platform operates through a simple interface that allows patients to describe their symptoms and be paired with a remote physician suitable for their specific health problems. Patients can receive consultations and, if necessary, directions for further tests or vital sign monitoring through partnered facilities or a specialized gadget.

71174,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"HealthOpX digitizes processes for food/diaper banks, religious and ethnic organizations to effectively partner with healthcare organizations to improve access to care for overlapping uninsured and Medicaid/Medicare populations.","<p>HealthOpX is addressing two points of the MIT Solve challenge
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<ul><li>Enable informed interventions, and decision-making by governments, local health systems, and aid groups by providing social determinants of health data and service history from our community organization partners
  </li></ul><ul><li>The partnerships we create between the community organizations and healthcare organizations are in low-income underserved communities, and our electronic referral platform improves accessibility and quality of health services for those communities.
   
   
  </li></ul><p>In addition, as a diverse company that is co-founded and owned by a 2nd generation Asian American, 2nd generation Latinx American, and black-American, we currently work with refugee organizations, food banks, diaper banks, churches, and other organizations across the U.S. that impact similar communities that our families grew up in. 
  </p>","<p>HealthOpX has built an in-house nonprofit CRM called HelpOpX that digitizes processes and member data for community organizations such as diaper banks, food banks, religious organizations, and ethnic organizations. This new and flexible technology specializes on low-tech nonprofits that have large amounts of data and service underserved communities that are uninsured or on Medicaid/Medicare. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Our nonprofit CRM has a custom plug-in that we built that allows community organizations to send electronic referrals to federally qualified health centers, case workers, and other relevant groups. This referral can send over survey data, social determinants of health data, notes on what the person needs, and nonprofit services the community member has received in the past so that healthcare professionals can accurately assess the needs of the patient. Community members can also scan a questionnaire QR code at the nonprofit site, or have it scanned for them if they do not have a smart phone and be automatically referred to different organizations on our network based on their needs. This could be for transportation needs, medical needs, housing needs, enrolling in food assistance programs, etc. This transforms the community organizations into a familiar access point of care for community members.
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Blending in individualized social determinants of health data and healthcare data as a healthcare organization or government organization allows them to make more informed decisions with interventions. It is also more useful than population health level data because outreach can be conducted at the individual level. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Bridging the technology gap for community organizations enables a natural partnership between community organizations, government organizations, and healthcare organizations to better serve their overlapping underserved communities and removes barriers to access care for those communities. 
  </p>","<p>The population we work with are people in the U.S. on Medicaid/Medicare, uninsured, or living below or around the ALICE threshold. The ALICE threshold is the minimum income level necessary for survival for a threshold. Specifically, the people that receive services or attend food banks, diaper banks, religious organizations, ethnic organizations, and community outreach organizations. One of the organizations we work with gives an example of the health needs of this population: the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama stated that 70% of those surveyed had high blood pressure which leads to stroke and heart disease. 37% of those surveyed have diabetes. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>There are rampant, correlative health issues related to poverty and social determinants of health. On average, a person will go to the food bank 7 times a year. We see that as 7 times that we could work with healthcare organizations to identify and address healthcare issues, create individualized treatment plans, or deliver preventative care resources catered to that individual. By providing these services, we are able to overcome barriers to transportation, access to care, and knowledge gaps for community members.
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>The easiest way to engage the population we are targeting is to show up at places where they are already asking for help and work with entities that they trust. By providing newly digitized data from community organizations to government and healthcare organizations, not only will there be the opportunity for positive healthcare outcomes, there will be opportunities for structural and policy change from the government.

<p>To provide some background on some of the barriers we face, Alabama is a very conservative state, and is not a Medicaid expansion state. Meaning, even though we seek to benefit the uninsured population there few monetary incentives outside of working with health systems and Medicaid/Medicare payers (health insurers). Although we were able to secure a paid pilot with a health system, the payers are very risk averse. Even if we can prove that we can get people to primary care physicians, case workers, and social assistance organizations, the payers need data that ties our services into outcomes, which typically takes a year or longer. This is a barrier we will run into in many states. </p>

These organizations are often the largest holders of up to date contact information, service information, and social determinants of health data for underserved communities. This newly digitized and structured data is extremely valuable for healthcare organizations, government organizations, and innovators to address needs and complete data sets at an individual level. Making it so that community organizations can easily work with these broader organizations without needing to be tech experts opens the door for collaboration that would positively impact underserved communities. Making community organization collaboration more accessible from a process, data, and security standpoint would break down barriers and catalyze more ideas and solutions targeting underserved communities. For example, we are able to leverage our community organization network, healthcare network, and government network to help those dis-enrolled from Medicaid re-determination.

  </p>
<p>In the past, electronic referral networks were made solely from a healthcare provider standpoint. These complex and hard to use systems made it nearly impossible for low-tech community organizations to participate. In fact, many community organizations still use paper, excel, and google forms.

<p> 
  </p>
<p>For our health education goals in improving health literacy, we are counting education materials handed out and using our nonprofit service tracker tool. When a nonprofit teaches a class on health education we are able to grab the member list and display it in our dashboard. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>For our care coordination goals of increasing access to primary care services and access to case workers we can see the list of completed referrals to different entities on our platform. To see if there is increased utilization of nonprofit services that benefit social determinants of health we are able to utilize our nonprofit service tracker tool. To see the total number of people screened for social determinants of health on our platform we are able to track this across all organizations using our in-house survey analytics/reporting tool.
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>On our platform we can track completed referrals to case workers and county governments when trying to determine how many people we were able to get re-enrolled onto Medicaid after Medicaid Re-Determination. Since people are not always accepted onto Medicaid after applying, we will have to check every quarter to reassess the referral to enrolled ratio.

  </p>
<p><strong>Five Year measurements for Good Health and Well-Being
  </strong></p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Measuring progress towards estimated amount of ER and urgent care visits reduced we will work with our healthcare partners and cross-reference our nonprofit service data with their electronic medical records. Leveraging the medical records from the healthcare partner and matching who received services from nonprofits we work with, we can see if the interventions and improved access to care we are creating through partnerships is influencing ER and urgent care visits in the zip codes we serve.
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Estimating the number of lives saved by early preventative screening and care interventions and reductions in death by cardiovascular disease correlated to high blood pressure is utilizing a mix of historical data and predictive modeling. Working with the healthcare and government partners we will see if our services have had an impact in the communities we are in vs. a control group of an nearly identical population. 
  </p>
<p> 
  </p>
<p>Estimating the number of new collaborations that address needs for underserved communities between newly digital community organizations, healthcare organizations, and government organizations will be continuously internally tracked within a master dashboard on our systems.

This partnership seeks to improve access to healthcare for uninsured and Medicaid/Medicare populations in the United States, with a specific focus on low-income, underserved communities. By leveraging an in-house developed nonprofit CRM named HelpOpX, the solution digitizes community organizations' processes and member data. This platform ensures that valuable social determinants of health data and service history are easily transferable to healthcare providers, improving informed interventions and decision-making capabilities.

The HealthOpX solution is currently at the Pilot stage. It is testing its product, service, or business model with a small number of users across Michigan and Alabama, impacting approximately 37,000 community members directly through various partnerships with community outreach organizations, Diaper Banks, the Community Food Bank of Central Alabama, and a health system pilot with the University of Alabama-Birmingham Health System among others.

HealthOpX directly addresses the challenge of improving the accessibility and quality of health services for underserved groups in fragile contexts by creating a technological solution that enables community organizations to work efficiently with healthcare providers. The platform facilitates the sharing of critical health and social determinants of health data through electronic referrals and questionnaires, thus becoming a vital tool in coordinating care and support for vulnerable populations.

The team behind HealthOpX consists of diverse co-founders with personal experiences of the challenges faced by their target communities, which drives their commitment to creating a solution that addresses health inequity through technology and partnerships. Their approach emphasizes diversity, equity, and inclusivity, with plans to expand their services across more states within the United States.

HealthOpX's revenue model involves charging a sliding scale fee to community organizations for using their CRM tool, and fees to healthcare systems and insurers for referrals and care coordination services. The team also pursues government grants and has received investments and grants from various sources, demonstrating a layered approach to achieving financial sustainability.

<p> It uses BarEl software, which we developed. It has a number of modules; including, a module for health. It uses database management and Excel.<br /></p>
<p>In order that governments in Africa honour their contributions to APHEF, budgets for ministries of health in Africa should have budget lines for APHEF so that tracking of their contributions should be done easily through expenditure reports. BarEl software has a budget line for APHEF; and through its expenditure analysis tool and its alert system, authorities at ministries of health and finance can take necessary action in the event of underexpenditure of APHEF budget line.</p>
<p>Our solution has a budget line for emergencies.<br /></p>
<p>It gives frontline health workers tools they need to  capture all health indicators like mortality rates, prevalence  and incidence of diseases.<br /></p>
<p>It  improves  transport management at a health facility by: </p>
<p>1. improving maintenance of vehicles.<br /></p>
<p>2. reducing or eliminating abuse of vehicles or fuel by drivers and other staff members.</p>
<p>BarEl software plays a pivotal role in nutrition Management; for example, by calculating calories lost, Body Mass Index  and Basal Metabolic Rate;hence, reduction in malnutrition and non-communicable diseases like Hypertension and Diabetes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the aid of BarEl software, the following are realised:<br /></p>
<p>Pilferage and shortage of drugs are eradicated or reduced through stock management methods like FIFO and LIFO.<br /></p>
<p>Delays in procuring drugs, stock-outs and cost of procuring drugs are reduced through Economic Order Quantity, improved procurement management, inventory management and different forecasting methods  like seasonal index, historical, exponential smoothing and moving averages.</p>
<p>Human resource management is immensely improved through  appraisal system, human resource planning, leave application process and preparing staff returns. Performance rating system facilitates retention of health workers. The staff return and leave application prevents shortage or overage of staff at any point in time.</p>
<p>Improved water management by ensuring provision of quality and enough water; thereby, reducing waterborne diseases. Furthermore, conflicts that arise because of water issues, among community members are reduced because each household  pays water bills and maintenance costs according to how much they consume. <br /></p>
<p>Water crises  are mitigated by construction of a water storage tank near a water point, so that at no point will taps or water points run dry due to excessive withdrawals.</p>
<p>Improved sanitation, waste management; and monitoring of toilet or latrine management.<br /></p>

<p>1. They are not getting the expected health outcomes because of poor delivery of services.</p>
<p>2. They have a challenge to access to health care.</p>
<p>3. They  lack health workers.</p>
<p>4. They can not get drugs because of shortage of drugs.</p>
<p>5. Critically ill patients or pregnant women end up dying because of lack of transport to take them to referral health facilities.</p>
<p>6. High prevalence and incidence of waterborne diseases due to unsafe drinking water and shortage of water.</p>
<p>7. Because of poor health, other social problems like poor education will creep in, affecting negatively the economic growth and development.</p>
<p>8. Some health facilities and health workers  fail to achieve optimum performance because their operations are 100% manual.<br /></p>
<p>The solution will address the needs of the target population by:<br /></p>
<ul><li>making readily available the financial resources from international bodies like the African Public Health Emergency Fund.</li><li>ensuring that the heath budget has a budget component for emergencies or contingencies or disasters.</li><li>securing water and sanitation for all.  
  </li><li>increasing equitable access to and quality of health care services.</li><li>reducing environmental and social risk factors that have a direct impact on health and by  improving food safety, hygiene and nutrition services.</li><li>improving the availability and quality of health infrastructure and medical equipment through strengthening transport system at all levels.
  </li><li>improving   availability, retention, performance and motivation of human resources for health for effective, efficient and equitable health service delivery.</li><li>improving recruitment capacity of health workers, enforcing implementation of performance based management, and strengthening the human resource planning process.</li><li>improving the availability, quality and utilization of medicines and medical  supplies by promoting an uninterrupted supply of quality essential medicines and medical supplies to  end-users.</li><li> generating quality information and make it accessible to all intended users for evidence-based decision-making.</li><li> enhancing adoption of ICT systems for routine data management.</li><li>strengthening of monitoring and evaluation of health plans.</li><li>implementing and strengthening expenditure analysis to monitor effective allocation of resources.</li><li> enhancing local capacities to conduct research.</li><li>strengthening accountability mechanisms and performance management across the system.</li><li>establishing the means for improving financial management and audit.</li><li>improving operations management.</li></ul><p>The above measures will result in:</p>
<ul><li>readily available funds for emergencies or disasters.</li><li>improved health and quality of the population for sustainable socio-economic development.</li><li>considerable reduction of death rate.</li><li>improved health care.</li><li>provision of clean water and good sanitation.</li><li>reduction or elimination of shortage or theft of drugs.</li></ul><ul><li>effective risk management.</li><li>improved financial management, improved transport management, improved monitoring and evaluation, improved procurement management, improved Human Resources Management, improved inventory management, improved operations management and improved project management.</li></ul><p>Generally, better health in fragile contexts will result in socio-economic development and prosperity, better transport system, infrastructure development, better health, better education; and reduction in crimes, juvenile delinquency, teenage pregnancies, population growth rate, poor housing, and other social problems.</p>

<p>Problems our people face, are the problems we have faced ourselves, and are still facing. </p>
<p>We have an empathy for the trap they are caught in. </p>
<p>We have a meaningful relationship with groups whose identity or experience are systemically stereotyped, feared, dismissed, or marginalized. </p>
<p>We have the experience, relationships, data, and knowledge that are essential for developing  measurable, sustainable, high-impact strategies and solutions. I know more about the health sector because of my mother, a retired nurse, and because I worked with the Ministry of Health in Malawi.</p>
<p>We are a part of our community; and we are meaningfully guided by our community’s input, ideas, needs, perspectives, agendas, and assets.</p>
<p>We ensure our communities participate in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation through surveys, suggestion boxes, focus groups, interviews, prototype and product review.</p>
<p>We motivate people in  our communities to be change-makers in their lives, families and communities.</p>
<p>We enhance collaborative processes with our communities through communication, coordination and  mutual support. We take advantage of local groups and free events that provide networking opportunities.</p>
<p>We are a team as well as friends who have supported each other in many ways. We come from the very community we are trying to help, enabling us to recognize both the challenges and assets our communities face.</p>
<p>We have ability to recognize and leverage assets and expertise within our communities we seek to support, that are often overlooked or misunderstood when viewed through a dominant culture lens.</p>
<p>We will create social media groups to learn and capture trends, and for communities to see and understand their own journey. We will use  data to enable other stakeholders, including government and philanthropists to better understand how our communities move out of poverty.</p>
<p>We practise<strong> Bricolage</strong>. We make with what we have and we make something unique and valued.</p>
<p>We nurture human potential.</p>
<p>We are asset-based in our view of those we wish to help. We view them as people filled with knowledge, skills, ideas, and solutions that if respected and supported, can advance sustainability, impact, and self-determination.</p>
<p>We have the following attributes:</p>
<p><strong>Human Dignity:</strong>  we  recognise that all people have unique gifts and assets.</p>
<p><strong>Connection</strong> :  intimate knowledge of our communities enable us to find  ways  that might not be as apparent to others who do not have their lived experience.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong> : we  recognize that we are part of a larger group walking together on the same path.  </p>
<p><strong>Agency : </strong>we ensure that everyone feels  that they can shape their future, relationships, and environment. </p>
<p><strong>A Sense of Possibility: </strong>We believe that  nothing is impossible.</p>
<p>We  lead, not follow experts in creating solutions to our community’s challenges.</p>
<p>We are not only  supported in creating solutions,  but we are also provided with resources to scale up solutions that are working. </p>
<p>We are not objects of charity, but drivers of change.</p>
<p>We support people and planet alongside profit. We are far from self-serving. </p>
<p>We are brave  to create positive social change.  We are passionate and persistent. </p>

Though BarEl software is based on Microsoft Access, it can be upgraded to Express Edition, which has a bigger capacity to store information. It can also be upgraded to SQL Microsoft Azure, which can enable it to reach many users worldwide through cloud services.</p>",A new application of an existing technology,,"Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning, Big Data, Software and Mobile Applications",Malawi,Zambia,Hybrid of for-profit and nonprofit,,"Four people work on the solution team.

He retired as Deputy Director of Finance in the Malawi Government. We are all full-time staff.",We have been working on our solution for four years.,"<p>Our approach to incorporating diversity, equity, and inclusivity into our work is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Employ people of different backgrounds. It is our policy to have the following as our employees: women, youths, persons with disabilities, ethnic minorities, people from different  racial or tribal backgrounds, people from different homes of origin, people of different religious and economic status. In fact, we have two women in our solution team; namely, Tiwonge Kuyokwa and Mwayi Mbewe. They are both Data Analysts.</p>
<p>2. Help employees to understand how individuals are impacted by unconscious bias, and what actions continue to reinforce biases. We encourage every employee to review, question, and analyze their own personal biases and assumptions.</p>
<p>3.  Respect and embrace other people's experiences and realities. Cultural humility is another way leaders and employees can manage bias and foster more inclusive environments.</p>
<p>4. Identify patterns or trends that may exist where certain groups of employees are underpaid within certain areas of the business; and observe equal pay for equal work.</p>
<p>5. Conduct diversity training that helps employees understand how cultural differences can impact how people work and interact at work. It can cover anything from concepts of time and communication styles to self-identity and dealing with conflict.</p>
<p>6. Promote awareness of, and acknowledge a variety of upcoming religious and cultural holidays. </p>
<p>7. Make it easy for our colleagues at work to participate in employee resource groups.</p>
<p>8. Ensure that people of different gender, cultural background or age are working together. Diversity in teams positively impacts creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>9. Encourage our colleagues at work to share their feedback to get a better understanding of what is going on under the surface.</p>
<p>10.Assess areas of the business in which discrimination can exist. Determine whether policies promote discrimination in the workplace such as racism or sexism; and then take corrective measures to move towards a more equitable workplace. </p>
<p>11. Believe in equity and justice.</p>
<p>12.Ensure that our leadership team is diverse by promoting women, people with disabilities, youths and ethnic minorities into leadership positions.</p>

  </p>",Government (B2G),"<p>Our plans for becoming financially sustainable are :</p>
<p>.selling our digital product BarEl software as a service sold per unit. Our customers can access our product through subscription. It is a licensed software. We offer freemiums to our potential customers. It is on Face Book marketplace.We aspire that it should be on other marketplaces like MIT Solve.</p>
<p>. charging a small fee for installation, maintenance, consultancy and training. We are also looking forward for grants or donations from MIT Solve or philanthropists or investors so that we scale our activities.</p>
<p>. charging different prices to different customers. Price discrimination will depend on size, location and type of customer.  Low income earners will be charged low prices. Government and corporate customers will be charged more than individual customers. Prices will also be charged on SaaS. The more features of BarEl software a customer acquires, the higher the price. We will  charge per year  $5 to individual customers with low income and $50 to corporate customers with no or low profits, and $1000 to governments or big corporate customers that are financially able. We will charge maintenance and installation fees.</p>
<p>. ensuring input efficiency by conducting trainings  en-masse and at once; hence,  reducing training cost per unit, resulting in  higher profit margins. </p>
<p>. scaling through:</p>
<p>a. vertical scaling. We will create partnerships .We will improve our product for small customers before targeting larger customers. We want to build relationships with more global brands to enable larger sales orders. And we will agree on how to share profits .  BarEl software is  multipurpose.</p>
<p>b. horizontal scaling : we will expand our offering to customers in neighbouring countries, then the Sub-Saharan Africa; and then, the whole world.  African market is largely untapped,and BarEl software is currently one of the few players in the space.</p>
<p>In addition, our revenue models that we will or we employ separately or as a combination:</p>
<p><strong>Hiring or Employment, </strong><strong>One-for-one model also known as buy-one give-one, </strong><strong>Service subsidization,</strong> A<strong>wareness &amp; Cause, </strong><strong>Environmental, </strong><strong>Entrepreneur support, </strong><strong>Organizational support, </strong><strong>Low-income client  and </strong><strong>Fee-for-service .</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transaction revenue</strong>: One-time sale of BarEl software or our services. </p>
<p><strong>Recurring revenue</strong>: Our customers will pay for access to a product or service in installments; usually, monthly or yearly.</p>
<p><strong>Service revenue</strong>: Our customers will pay periodically, and for our expertise. </p>
<p><strong>Advertisements</strong>. We will sell ad space. </p>
<p>Furthermore, our plans for becoming financially sustainable are through:</p>
<p>. selling consultancy services to government and other customers.</p>
<p>. service contracts to governments.</p>
<p>. raising investment capital.</p>
<p>. diversifying donor base and developing long-term partnerships with donors. We will continue to rely on donations and grants. </p>
<p>. effectively and efficiently managing financial and physical resources.</p>
<p>. developing new partnerships, boost existing relations with donors, beneficiaries and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The Total Addressable Market in Malawi is $15 million. And for Africa, it is is $35 billion.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p> Some examples of how our plan to achieve financial sustainability has been successful so far are:</p>
<ul><li>Our organisation has a hybrid structure i.e. it has a traditional approach of generating income through sale of BarEl software and through receiving grants or donations; hence, reduction in reliance on the gen­eros­ity of donors.</li><li>We increase rev­enue through sale of BarEl software or training provided to users of BarEl software. We  achieve this by increasing customer base through promotional activities. Scalability is done through use of internet and entering more markets; including national, regional and global markets. It is on YouTube as well as on Face Book marketplace. </li><li>We want to join  other platforms or marketplaces like MIT Solve.</li><li>The solution is scaled to affect lives of more people living in low and middle income countries; hence, more revenue.</li></ul><ul><li>We have so far created partnerships, which are already bearing fruits. Sales revenues realised or that will be realised from such partnerships  will help to subsidise  costs of the project, and will also be used to fund social programs. We will also be advertising our software called BarEl on partner websites. </li><li>Below are some of our partners:   </li></ul><p>a)    BSL , an IT company of Tanzania with strong links to India, Serosoft,  an IT company of India with branches in USA and Europe, EMD Consulting Engineers of Malawi,  University of Livingstonia in Malawi and NBM Development Bank of Malawi.</p>

This software solution intends to address a range of systemic health service challenges exacerbated by emergencies and underfunding. It specifically targets the African Public Health Emergency Fund (APHEF) contribution issue by creating a budget line that enables ministries of health in Africa to track their contributions efficiently. Furthermore, it promotes improved health system infrastructure through accurate, actionable health-related data and governance enhancements.

The proposal outlines how the software will directly contribute to various health system components, including workforce capacity building, supply chain management, and primary care services improvement. It incorporates modules to manage health indicators, improve transport for healthcare access, manage nutrition, and secure drug supplies through better stock management. Additionally, the software offers capabilities for human resource management, water management, and sanitation improvements. The development stage of the product is classified as Pilot, indicating that the team is testing the product with a small user base through their client, EMD Consulting Engineers, affecting hundreds of people.

The solution targets a broad spectrum of individuals, including women, children, ethnic minorities, and marginalized groups, addressing barriers to healthcare access, quality of service, and environmental health factors contributing to disease prevalence. The team is composed of individuals with direct experiences and connections to the healthcare sector in Malawi, including professionals with backgrounds in business administration, data analysis, and health.

To expand their reach and achieve their impact goals, the team seeks financial assistance, strategic advice, and technological support to scale their solution. They aim to address a wide range of UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Good Health and Well-being, Clean Water and Sanitation, and Reduced Inequalities, among others.

The business model outlined suggests a blend of direct sales of the software, training services, and prospective funding through grants and donations. The solution is touted as innovative due to its comprehensive approach to addressing health system challenges in fragile contexts through a multi-functional software platform.

The team's financial sustainability plans involve scaling the solution through vertical and horizontal strategies, partnership development, and adopting a flexible pricing model to accommodate a diverse client base, aiming at a significant market potential in Malawi and beyond.

71335,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Taping into the knowledge and skills of people who have lived experience to guide change in the mental health sector,"<p>Our world is reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, wars, displacement, and the climate emergency, all of which have consequences for the well-being of world citizens. The rates of people experiencing suicidal ideation are increasing globally, and about one in eight people live with a mental disorder; it is the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLDs), accounting for one in every six YLDs globally, according to WHO. 75% to 95% of people with mental disorders in low- and middle-income countries cannot access mental health services at all, and governments spend, on average, just over 2% of their health budgets on mental health, resulting in a treatment gap of 80%. In addition Mental health disorders account for 13% of the global burden of disease, and this figure will rise to nearly15% by 2030 according to WHO </p>
<p>The Ministry of Health estimates that 25% of Kenyans have a mental health issue at any given time. However, according to a WHO 2017 report, the Kenyan government spends only 0.01% of its total health expenditure on mental health. As a result of this treatment gap, WHO estimates that 80% of those affected do not receive the professional assistance they need. </p>
<p>Generally, people with mental health illnesses are highlighted as a vulnerable group subject to stigma and social isolation, human rights violations, and exclusion from policies and decision-making that affect them (WHO, 2010). In many places, formal mental health services do not exist; Even when they are available, they are often inaccessible or unaffordable, and too often, they are subjected to human rights abuses by some of the very health services responsible for their care. As a result, people will often choose to endure mental distress without treatment rather than risk facing prejudice and ostracization that comes with accessing mental health services. This problem worsens medically underserved populations and impoverished and marginalized communities.
</p>
<p>For decades, the design and implementation of mental health services and interventions has been done without the input of those who use and require the services. For the few that have, people with lived experience are not included at the decision-making table. This has resulted in mental health services and interventions that do not address the specific needs of people experiencing  mental health illnesses, negatively impacting them. </p>","<p>Our solution taps into Lived Experience Experts ( a person who has a personal experience with a mental illness or a caregiver who has intimate experience in supporting a person living with a mental condition).These experts have special person-centered knowledge gained from first-hand experience with a mental condition which is often missed within the mental health field and have essential skills and knowledge beyond just the experience of a mental condition and recovery. It encompasses an understanding of marginalization, oppression, and discrimination. </p>
<p>This Experts provides this knowledge and skills through mental health trainings. Where the lived experience experts are the lead trainers supported by experts by training. This trainings are done virtually taking advantage of the development of online platforms such as zoom, google meet, etc. during the pandemic that has enabled us to do so much virtually.</p>
<p>It incorporates storytelling, as stories have the power to elicit emotional responses, put a face to an issue, connect us to deeper issues, and humanize us, resulting in inspiration, teaching, clarification, and mobilization. The Experts share their lived experiences as practical examples. </p>
<p>The Experts use the platform as well to provide psychoeducation services ( <strong>the process of providing education and information to those seeking or receiving mental health services) </strong></p>
<p>Lastly, provision of psychosocial support services:</p>
<ol><li>Support groups. Run by trained peers and focus on emotional support, sharing experiences, education and practical activities</li><li>one-to-one support .meeting trained peer to talk about how you’re feeling or to set goals.</li></ol><p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The main beneficiaries are young people aged 15 to 35 who have mental health conditions in Nakuru, particularly in low-income settings and rural .By just having a mental health illness, due to cultural beliefs, it is extremely difficult to live with a mental health condition in Africa.</p>
<p>Most Africans view mental health illness as a result of an external attack on the person. Those experiencing  mental health illnesses are thought to be under a spell or bewitched, and as a result, they face stigma and social isolation, human rights violations, and exclusion from policies and decision-making that affect them, limiting their participation in all aspects of society, including social, economic, and political aspects. In addition to the lack of mental health services as a result many choose to suffer in silence rather than face the stigma and discrimination that comes with mental health illness. This problem is exuberated for those living in low income settings and those in rural areas.</p>
<p>It expands coverage and access to mental health services and information ( mental health training, psychoeducation services, and psychosocial services). Reduce the cost of access to services and information for beneficiaries because all other services are free excepted the mental health training services which are costed 50-60% below the market rate; the only cost is internet data.</p>
<p>Persons living with mental health conditions empowerment socially, economically, and politically as a result of  psychoeducation, psychosocial support and mental health trainings, which opens up conversations about mental health in order to normalize its prevalence, change people's attitudes toward mental health, and influence how people interact with people living with mental health conditions.

The solution leverages the expertise of Lived Experience Experts—individuals who have personally encountered mental health issues or cared for someone who has—to lead mental health training, supported by professionals in the field. These training sessions are conducted virtually, utilizing online platforms like Zoom and Google Meet, which have gained popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. The program includes storytelling as a key component to facilitate emotional connection, education, and inspiration. Additionally, it offers psychoeducation and psychosocial support services, including support groups and one-to-one consultations, all aimed at young people aged 15 to 35 in Nakuru, Kenya.

The proposal identifies a critical problem: the global and local rise in mental health disorders juxtaposed against the inadequacy of mental health services, exacerbated by stigma and a lack of inclusive policy-making. Specifically, it notes that in Kenya, despite a high prevalence of mental health issues, there is minimal government expenditure on mental health, leading to a significant treatment gap. The solution seeks to mitigate these issues by enhancing the availability, accessibility, and quality of mental health services, aiming to empower individuals living with mental health conditions socially, economically, and politically. The approach is innovative in its centering of lived experience in the design and delivery of mental health interventions, aiming to ensure these services are relevant, culturally sensitive, and effective.

The team, comprising young individuals with lived experience in mental health, is executing the solution in the pilot stage. It is demonstrated by their initial engagement of 672 young people at risk of or living with mental health conditions. The team's intimate understanding of the beneficiaries' context and needs, given their personal experiences and demographic alignment, is a crucial strength of this proposal.

To scale their impact, the team seeks mentorship along with both non-monetary and monetary support to enhance their organizational systems, including accounting, monitoring and evaluation, human resource management, marketing, and refining scaling strategies. Their business model relies on providing subsidized mental health services, funded through donations, fundraising, and the revenue generated from their consultancy services.

The proposal delineates a theory of change that includes delivering mental health trainings, psychoeducation, psychosocial support, and advocacy, leading to short-term outcomes such as improved mental health knowledge and social support systems. The long-term goal encompasses enhanced quality of life, social participation, and stigma reduction for individuals with mental health conditions. They measure progress through the number of people trained, the extent of community awareness, and the personal development of individuals engaging with their services.

Regarding inclusivity, the organization emphasizes diversity in its team composition and activities, ensuring representation of individuals from various backgrounds, including those with psychosocial disabilities, women, young people, and different ethnicities. The business model and plan for financial sustainability involve pursuing a mix of donations, grants, and revenue from their subsidized services, with an aim toward broadening their funding base to ensure long-term viability.","{'criterion_1': {'result': 'pass', 'reason': 'The proposal is written in English and answers all required questions with sufficient detail.

71724,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Semi-Finalist,"Grace Health is the leading women’s health platform in emerging markets with over 1.3 million users in Sub Saharan Africa, providing radical accessibility to affordable healthcare.","<p>There are 1.2B women in low and middle-income countries with access to a mobile phone, however, despite this, 48% of Africa’s population lack access to adequate care. Grace Health is committed to addressing the problem of inadequate access to women's health information and services in emerging markets. This problem is caused by several factors, including the high cost of healthcare, limited distribution of healthcare professionals, and societal stigma surrounding women's health. A sentiment to the lack of available healthcare can be seen in the fact that according to the Nigerian National Bureau of Statistics, the average Nigerian will pay 10% of their yearly income on one single hospital visit. Moreover, healthcare is heavily inaccessible: there is an average of 3.42 doctors per 10,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa, compared to 39.0 doctors per 10,000 people in Europe. These issues contribute to a faulty healthcare ecosystem that disproportionately affects women. </p>
<p>Lack of access to sexual and reproductive health and rights has a detrimental impact on individuals and communities. It leads to higher maternal death rates and prevents individuals from living healthy and productive lives. It also negatively impacts economic development, as healthy populations are more productive and save more. Furthermore, when women are denied access to healthcare and the ability to make informed decisions, their education and economic opportunities are limited, further perpetuating gender inequality in their communities. By addressing the problem of inadequate access to women's health in emerging markets, Grace Health aims to improve the overall health and well-being of individuals and communities.</p>","<p>Our solution begins by building with intention, taking into account both the low-resource environment of our target market and the low health literacy of our users. The app caters for several of her needs such as period and health tracking, personalised health assessments, automated SRHR chat, education within family planning and STIs and linking her to telehealth or physical tests and care. Grace health uses engaging features and content to raise awareness and empower women to take control of their bodies, creating behavioural changes for good. We are a platform for her to manage her reproductive health, and through incentivised actions, we nudge her towards health empowerment. In return for completing an action within the app, our users will receive currency they can apply to health services or products from our partners. Positive health actions may include conducting a breast cancer self examination, consuming educational health content or logging her health data. The app itself aggregates big data that allows societies to access aggregated and anonymized data for macro decision-making and patient engagement.  </p><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_1iat3khPjq8HYu-0zQj_rzmi_hvBKV-/view?usp=sharing"">https://drive.google.com/file/...</a></p><p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution serves women of fertile age, 15-49, within emerging markets. Our user either wants to get pregnant, avoid pregnancy or learn more about her body.

She does not know enough about hormones, menstruation, fertility, or other female health conditions such as cervical cancer or endometriosis, to make informed decisions about the way to live her life. Therefore, she turns to Grace. Grace Health opens up conversations about female topics and guides her toward achieving her goals. Grace breaks down biases and educates users on her body, life, and health, in ways that no others can. Grace Health will give women the power to carve out their life path by equipping them with health access and education. We will allow them to participate in active family planning, monitor symptoms to prevent the worsening of underlying conditions, and build a health agency. In turn, they can pursue education, gain employment, and actively contribute to their community's economy and future development. </p>","<p>Over the past five years, our team has successfully built Grace Health to be the #1 health app trusted across Sub-Saharan Africa. Our team is nimble and backed by years of experience in emerging markets, driving positive change through social impact, and working on digital service and product development. Founder and CEO Estelle Westling launched Kinnevik-backed Tonaton Ghana, Ghana's leading marketplace, which in less than two years established itself as more well-known than Youtube with a team of 70 employees. Prior to Grace Health, co-founder Therese Mannheimer was the Head of R&amp;D at the market-leading health app Lifesum and spent six years as a partner and strategist at the global design firm Doberman. We have also made it a point to have team members located directly in the regions we serve, primarily Nigeria and Kenya. Currently, we have two members of our team in Nigeria working in Product Design and Product Management. Our team in Kenya is dedicated to Social Media Coordination, Sales and Marketing Management, and Backend Engineering. By employing a global team, we remain involved in the markets we serve, and as such, can provide an even better solution. We keep the marketing team in Kenya so that they can create content, design, campaigns and offerings that correspond to the trends they can see in their communities. As such, they can get at the heart of our users as they can sympathise with and relate to the same problems and opportunities. </p>
<p>In terms of our solution, understanding our customer drives the betterment of our product. By analysing the engagement with our app we can deduce the services most utilised by our customers. For example, recent data has shown that 93% use the symptom tracker, 80% use the chat, 66% use the period tracker and 60% rely on educational content. By taking this data we can improve our services and also use the engagement data to personalise the content to specific customers.

These solutions fail as they have developed services for the Western customer which sets them up to provide niche value to those who can afford the data and bandwidth to use their services. They have not taken into consideration the low data resource settings of emerging markets, nor have they accounted for the lack of purchasing power. Moreover, current solutions are rational, not relational. For intimate concerns on reproductive health, women want a relational approach in terms of content tonality and service delivery. Google is also a substitute since it distributes health information and advice, however, the search engine has several limits. Firstly, users do not know what information to trust or who is qualified to give out information. Secondly, like the other solutions available, Google does not take a relational role which hinders conversations about the topics that our users want to address.</p>
<p>The Grace app is built specifically for emerging markets and the next billion users, unlike any other solution available.

72277,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"NeuroSole is a portable, cheap, non-invasive, and easy-to-use early diagnostic system for Parkinson’s disease.","<p>Parkinson's disease (PD) has the fastest-rising prevalence of all neurological diseases, affecting up to 10 million individuals. In addition, in 2022 nearly 90,000 patients have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, a steep 50% increase from preceding years, making it the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States. </p>
<p>For diagnosis, patients have to go through numerous exhaustive, expensive, and time-consuming tests such as DaTscan, MRI, and PET scans to rule out other diseases. Patients also spend an average of $2,500 to obtain the necessary examinations before diagnosis. The symptoms of Parkinson’s are also similar to that of Lewy body dementia, and muscular dystrophy, making it even harder for doctors to diagnose Parkinson’s. </p>
<p>Currently, Parkinson's is misdiagnosed up to 30% of the time and according to Parkinson’s UK 34% of people that were misdiagnosed reported a decline in health. This leads many patients to develop Parkinson's symptoms 1-2 years before their official diagnosis, leading to worsened conditions and chronic symptoms. Moreover, according to ParkinsonsDisease.net, “diagnosing PD early is important because treatments such as levodopa/carbidopa are more effective when administered early on in the disease.” Thus, the increase in  late or misdiagnosis leads to ineffectiveness of medications and ongoing progression of the disease. </p>
<p>Altogether, due to a lack of an accessible, affordable, and accurate diagnostic system available for patients in the early stages prevents them from taking further action in order to slow the progression of the disease.</p>","<p>NeuroSole is a novel diagnostic tool that utilizes a 1D convolutional neural networks model to analyze Parkinsonian gait patterns, which are one of the earliest symptoms in Parkinson’s. To obtain data points regarding one's gait, each pair of NeuroSole insoles are embedded with 12 pressure sensors to transmit the ground reaction forces to the 1D convolutional neural network model. The sensors placed in the insoles of the shoe record the pressure points during each phase of the gait cycle. To accurately assess the patient's gait, six sensors are positioned in each insole: one sensor near the toes, two in the metatarsal region, one in the midfoot, and two near the heel. The data points collected by the sensors are sent from the Arduino Uno to the Raspberry Pi which then sends the data to the cloud where the data is processed and used to detect the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s using the 1D-Convnet model.   </p>
<p>NeuroSole comes with the insoles and a free downloadable app. The app displays the results of the examination, allows users to monitor symptoms, and share results with caregivers. To use NeuroSole, the user has to download the app on their mobile, insert the insoles into their shoes and enable the app to start tracking. After a short walk of 2-3 minutes, the app immediately reports the likelihood of developing PD and if desired the results can be shared with caregivers. Patients can use our product on a regular basis to monitor the progression.  </p>
<p>To develop the model, the 1D CNN algorithm was used as it can perform activity recognition tasks such as standing, walking, or jumping. We also used software applications like the Raspberry Pi OS and the Arduino IDE to read in the sensor values and develop the model. </p>
<p>Demo video: <a href=""https://youtu.be/2ue34Lw69H0"">https://youtu.be/2ue34Lw69H0</a><br /></p>","<p>The demographics of our primary target market encompass individuals who are 50+ across the globe. The psychographics are individuals looking for immediate, cheap, and non-invasive alternatives to diagnose Parkinson’s in its early stages. This also includes individuals who are cautious about their health, have poor health records, or could possibly inherit the disease from close family members. The secondary target market includes disorder movement specialists and neurologists who want to verify the diagnosis results and monitor their patient's symptoms and progression over long gaps between visits. Our very first customers include patients at local hospitals, neurologist's clinics, and the elderly individuals in our local community. </p>
<p>Currently our target market doesn’t have other alternatives on the market to accurately diagnose Parkinson’s in its early stages in the comfort of the homes. Our product aims to provide an effective solution where users can diagnose in the comfort of the homes while intervening at the proper time to make treatments such as Carbidopa-levodopa more effective at managing symptoms. Through our product, we hope to increase the effectiveness of medication and decrease the number of patients that are misdiagnosed in the coming years. In the long run, NeuroSole can provide individuals with peace of mind and allow them to lead active and independent lives. </p>","<p>My twin sister and I have decided to work together on creating a life-changing product that draws from our shared life experiences and knowledge. This problem matters to us because our grandfather was diagnosed with stage 3 Parkinson's, which made us recognize the invaluable need for tools that can help patients to diagnose neurological diseases like Parkinson’s in its early stages. The community of individuals with neurodegenerative diseases remain very close to our heart. Our experience motivates us to create a product that will assist millions of patients worldwide to take necessary medications at the appropriate time. Our product will aid neurologists by streamlining the diagnostic process and simultaneously helping patients take preventative care as needed. </p>
<p>Currently, our product was also recognized by the Global Conrad Challenge where our project received the Power Pitch award from among 950+ teams. In addition, we have already applied for a provisional patent on the integration of sensors onto the insoles. Furthermore, we have a strong background in computer science as we both advanced to the finals in ACSL, and are currently silver contestants in USACO. Moreover, we have strong fundamentals in business and have been competitively successful in DECA by placing in ICDC, which will allow us to build a strong business model for our company. In addition, in our first two years of high school we performed extensive research on neurodegenerative disease similar to Parkinson’s and received statistically significant results and even published the results in the Harvard Journal of Emerging Investigators. We have also been recognized for our research on neurodegenerative disorders by the city council and mayor. All of this will allow us to develop a one-of-a-kind product that caters to our customers by solving the current drawbacks in the market. </p>","Enable continuity of care, particularly around primary health, complex or chronic diseases, and mental health and well-being.","Cupertino, CA",United States,"Prototype: A venture or organization building and testing its product, service, or business model, but which is not yet serving anyone",<p>Our solution is in the prototype stages because we have successfully developed our first MVP product of the insoles with the integration of the sensors and the app where the results will be displayed.

The sensors record the pressure points during each phase of the gait cycle. To accurately assess the patient's gait, six sensors are positioned in each insole: one sensor near the toes, two in the metatarsal region, one in the midfoot, and two near the heel.

The Raspberry Pi then sends the data to the cloud where the data is processed and used to detect the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s using the 1D-Convnet model.   </p>
<p>In order to develop the AI model, the Gait in Parkinson's Disease dataset was obtained from PhysioNet. The dataset is a collection of multichannel recordings from force sensors beneath the feet of 93 patients with Parkinson's Disease and 73 healthy controls. The dataset contains the vertical component of the ground reaction forces from the sensors placed on the insole of each foot. For the data pre-processing, the first and last 15 seconds of the walking were removed to ignore the starting and stopping disturbances. Furthermore, for the feature extraction, the most prominent features were analyzed such as swing time, stride time, gait asymmetry, and double stance time for both feet.

The system comprises a pair of insoles equipped with 12 pressure sensors that capture ground reaction forces during the gait cycle. This data is processed using a 1D convolutional neural networks model to assess the likelihood of developing PD. The insoles are complemented by a free downloadable app that displays examination results, enables symptom monitoring, and facilitates sharing of data with caregivers.

The solution addresses the critical problem of PD misdiagnosis and the challenges associated with the current diagnostic process, which is often exhaustive, expensive, time-consuming, and prone to misdiagnosing PD 30% of the time. By providing an accessible, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostic tool, NeuroSole aims to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment interventions, which are crucial for managing symptoms and improving patients' quality of life. 

NeuroSole targets individuals over 50 worldwide seeking convenient alternatives for early PD diagnosis and healthcare professionals, including neurologists and movement disorder specialists, looking to supplement their diagnostic and patient monitoring processes. The solution is currently in the prototype stage, having developed a minimum viable product (MVP) that combines the sensor-embedded insoles with the accompanying app. The development team plans to refine the product based on feedback from neurologists and potential users to ensure its effectiveness and user satisfaction.

The team behind NeuroSole includes individuals with personal connections to PD, significant recognition for their project (e.g., the Power Pitch award from the Global Conrad Challenge), a provisional patent for their technology, and strong backgrounds in computer science and business. They have also performed extensive research on neurodegenerative diseases, yielding statistically significant results published in academic journals.

NeuroSole’s innovation lies in its novel application of insole-based pressure sensors and AI to diagnose PD early, distinguishing it from existing diagnostic tools and apps in the market that do not offer quantitative data analysis for PD diagnosis. The team aims to reduce the rate of PD misdiagnoses by 5% to 10% in the next few years and improve patients' lifespans by facilitating early and accurate diagnosis.

Regarding its business model, NeuroSole plans to sell directly to consumers through an eCommerce platform and partner with retail stores, targeting early adoption by patients and healthcare professionals.

72726,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,"TumiApp is a mobile application that uses Artificial Intelligence with the ability to gamify the self-care of patients and families with limited literacy skills in rural areas. The current proposal focuses on the design, implementation and measurement for the prevention of the disease","<p>TB is a cone-shaped infectious disease that kills millions of people every year worldwide, especially young women in economically vulnerable situations. In Latin America, hundreds of thousands of cases are reported each year, with Colombia being one of the countries most affected by the disease, particularly in the department of Cauca due to its low development index and difficult socio-economic situation. Generally, the regions that are most affected by the disease, especially in Cauca, involve people belonging to various ethnic groups or mix raced communities, such as Afro-descendants, indigenous people and peasants. In addition, these communities have low scholarity, limiting skills such as reading or writing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, health systems have tried to alleviate the consequences of TB through treatments that ensure a better quality of life for patients, as well as raising awareness among their families and large communities. However, many patients find it difficult to successfully follow treatments and physicians’ recommendations that contribute to self-care. This is due to several factors including: lack of education about the disease or how to properly take care of themselves, lack of access to health services, lack of resources to access treatment, and lack of emotional and social support. For this reason, tools are urgently needed to knock down barriers, especially technological ones, given the geographical difficulties that patients in these regions may face.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, due to the rise in Information Technology and its exponential development during the last decades, there are more people who have access to mobile device allowing them to not only communicate with their families but also be in contact with the exterior world. In this sense, tools for mobile devices (apps) have shown themselves to be promising alternatives that allow users to interact with the most modern trends related to various issues but especially in relation to the monitoring, treatment and support of a chronic disease. In the case of this project, mobile technology becomes an instrument to improve and strengthen the results of a follow-up and monitoring program, as well as the possibility of providing greater adherence to treatments in general. Studies developed in India, Africa, the USA, the UK and Moldova, among other countries, show that the use of mobile applications has improved anti-tuberculosis treatments and self-care.</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>The TumiApp is an innovative solution to address the problem of the lack of TB literacy in the rural region of the department of Cauca, especially in areas with a high density of vulnerable communities. This application seeks to improve the self-care of TB patients and their families through the effective use of gamification and visual interaction with a virtual character called Tumi who follows the concept of a kind of Tamagotchi, which means that he requires constant care and attention from the user, thereby creating an emotional bond. Through interaction with Tumi, patients and their families can learn about TB, preventive measures, the importance of treatment compliance and self-care. In addition, TumiApp allows patients to be accompanied and their quality of life and that of their families to be improved indirectly.</p>
<p> It is worth to mention that the Tumi character has been conceived without any particular ethnic or gender affiliation, which makes it more adaptable to a community without any distinction and can generate greater sense so belonging without being intrusive to the socio-cultural environment of the patients and their close circle. Furthermore, the application itself allows for inclusivity in the sense that it has been conceived for people with literacy limitations through the effective use of images, graphic symbols, audio, and animations.</p>","<p>TumiApp is designed for TB patients and their families living in the municipalities of the department of Cauca: (1) Santander de Quilichao, (2) Villarrica, (3) Puerto Tejada, (4) Caldono and (5) Piendamó. It should be noted that both patients and their families face a number of challenges such as limited access to information about the disease, little understanding of the importance of treatment, difficulties in complying with supervised treatment and lack of knowledge about self-care, in addition to limitations in literacy skills.
  </p>
<p>Thus, TumiApp offers a solution to the above problems by providing clear and accessible information related to TB, its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and self-care measures during the course of the disease and disease remission conditions. The app also offers medication reminders, schedules for check-ups and medical appointments, as well as tools for monitoring treatment progress and psycho-emotional support when needed.<br /></p>
<p> Also, the use of Artificial Intelligence for gamification allows the application to be more interactive and attractive to patients with limited reading and writing skills, which generates a better understanding and participation in the treatment, as well as activities designated by the program agent for self-care. In addition to the above, the application increases the local capacity of hospitals covering the rural environment of the region, favors interaction with health professionals, patients can more easily adapt to self-care interventions, and increases the quality of treatment adherence monitoring in patients with low health system coverage who are located in fragile contexts, thus improving health outcomes at the primary care level.
  
 Specifically, TumiiApp can have a significant impact on the lives of patients and their families by improving understanding of the disease and increasing adherence to treatment, improving health outcomes, strengthening the self-care capacities of patients, their families and neighbors through word of mouth communication about TB self-care knowledge and health practices, bringing health services closer to the communities and reducing the cost of health care as well as the burden of disease in rural and dispersed areas of the department of Cauca, becoming a pilot and a national benchmark.</p>","<p>The team has experience in application development, research and creation projects, as well as in design and programming of mobile applications, user experience, interface design, user research, digital illustration, animation and software development methodologies with researchers from the CAMALEÓN research group of the Universidad del Valle and the Information Technology R&amp;D Group -GTI- of the Universidad del Cauca.</p>

For the development of the application, user research will be carried out and, based on task scripts, mental models will be discovered with the aim of defining conceptual models according to their particularities based on Experience Design.</p>
<p> In addition to the above, the team ensures the development of the application and its adaptation following the premises of User-Centred Design and Accessibility taking into account literacy limitations. Summarising, the steps of the ""Design Research Process"" (DRP) will be considered as a valid methodology of scientific research and development of application projects, composed of 6 phases; 1) identification of the problem according to the results of the interdisciplinary diagnosis and the assessment with a group of experts in the problem, 2) establishing objectives of the solution, 3) design and implementation, 4) piloting, 5) measurement and 6) communication.</p>

73183,Health in Fragile Contexts Challenge,Published,Providing health care services under the most extreme conditions by leveraging on technology and enhanced application of existing structures.,"<p>Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country with over 200 million inhabitants, many of them underserved. There are multiple challenges in accessing adequate healthcare for a large proportion of the populace, particularly for the hard to reach communities .During COVID 19 Pandemic for instance, access to health care was constrained due to lack of adequate isolation centres and transportation challenges to access the available ones due to the restricted movement amid social distancing measures. As a consequence the WHO states that as of March 2023, only about 14% of the total population has received the booster dose, a far cry from the required 70% that ensures herd immunity. The focus of our solution is on the hard-to-reach areas with limited access to the healthcare system where a large proportion of Nigeria’s inhabitants live.</p>
<p>Nigeria has a primary-healthcare system with an administrative unit of the local government areas. There is a central Local government Area store in each LGA of the federation which should be stocked from the state Central store with medicines, vaccines and other essential supplies. However, there is a preponderance of stockouts at the LGA level. 
  </p>
<p>The health centre and dispensary is the basic unit of primary healthcare which is usually managed by a health worker. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>","<p>Our solution is two-fold. First, the establishment (or activation where they already exist) of mobile medical teams including at least a community health extension workers and at least one support staff  using enhanced tricycles to provide medical outreach services to the hard to reach communities. A selection of specific tricycle operators in the host communities in order to leverage on existing structures will be employed. These enhanced tricycles can also serve as ambulances to bring the sick to the secondary level care centre in cases of need and should be equipped with telemedicine facilities to allow the remote follow-up of patients on chronic care and consultation of emergent cases.</p>
<p>The second part will be the use of drones to manage stockouts of vaccines and other essential supplies and medicines from the state central store to the LGA stores and in dire emergencies, delivery of medical supplies directly to the patients.
  </p>
<p>Our solution would be piloted in one state of Nigeria ( Kebbi State), with 21 LGAs. One drone and a back up will be deployed at the state level with 23 enhanced tricycles (including 2 back-ups). The ambulances will be staffed and manned by staff from the state primary healthcare development agency and the referral hospital for telemedicine consultation and referral of patients will be General Hospital Argungu in Kebbi state.
</p>","<p>Prompt access to health care will ensure the curtailing of unneccessary deaths and medical complications arising from lack of adequate medical care. Rural outreach will be enhanced, and the cost and quality of health care services will be greatly improved, as more effort can be deployed in improving the standard of already established and functional secondary health care facilities rather than increasing the number of primary health care facilites which comes with added cost and maintenance challenges. The new primary healthcare facilities also tend to be moribund after just a few years of establishment as experience has shown, with the aim of their establsihment summarily defeated. Our mobile teams and facilites can easily be upgraded in order to provide up-to-date services to the communities based on ever changing physical and environmental factors.</p>","<p>The team is built solid, made up of an assemblage of researchers and health care practitioners. We have medical consultants, and biomedically qualified engineers with  foreign expertise and years of solutions delivery. Our team is also domiciled within the host communities, and are either locals, or have sound relationship with them. We engaged in dialogue with the locals during the COVID 19 pandemic and were able to understand these challenges as being critical to the lack of coverage of the populace by the vaccine. Ultimately, these challenges have been found to be sistemic to whole healthcare delivery system of the country, hence the need for a digital revision in conformity with the digital age.</p>","Increase local capacity and resilience in health systems, including the health workforce, supply chains, and primary care services","Our Solution is heaquartered in Kaduna State, NorthWest Nigeria.",Nigeria,"Concept: An idea for building a product, service, or business model that is being explored for implementation; please note that Concept-stage solutions will not be reviewed or selected as Solver teams",,<p>We are still at the conception stage of development and hence haven't engaged any participants.</p>,"<p>MIT is known to collaborate wit many higher institutions of learning in Nigeria, with some of my mates at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria having benefitted from such initiatives.

This solution intends to address the challenges of inadequate healthcare access, exacerbated during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, by leveraging technology and optimizing existing healthcare infrastructure.

The first component of the solution involves deploying mobile medical teams equipped with enhanced tricycles. These teams, comprising community health extension workers and support staff, aim to provide medical outreach services directly to communities in need. The tricycles, aside from facilitating outreach, are designed to serve as ambulances and are equipped with telemedicine capabilities for remote patient follow-up and emergency consultations.

The second component focuses on the use of drones to alleviate stockouts of essential medical supplies, vaccines, and medicines by facilitating prompt delivery from state central stores to LGA stores and, in urgent cases, directly to patients.

The proposal specifies the pilot implementation in Kebbi State, detailing the allocation of one drone and a backup unit at the state level, alongside 23 enhanced tricycles, including two backups, to support the initiative. This structure is planned to work in collaboration with the state primary healthcare development agency and General Hospital Argungu for telemedicine consultations and patient referrals.

The target beneficiaries are the residents of hard-to-reach areas, with the solution aiming to significantly reduce unnecessary deaths and medical complications by improving prompt access to healthcare services. This approach is presented as a cost-effective alternative to expanding physical primary healthcare facilities, which often become non-operational a few years after establishment.

The solution team is described as a collective of researchers, healthcare practitioners, and biomedically qualified engineers with local ties to the communities they aim to serve. Their understanding of the systemic healthcare delivery challenges in Nigeria forms the basis of their proposed digital-centric revision of healthcare services.
